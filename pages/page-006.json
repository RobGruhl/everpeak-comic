He's swinging a heavy blacksmith's hammer down onto glowing red-hot metal on the anvil. BUT - sparks are flying in WRONG directions (sideways, upward in odd angles instead of normal spray). Gear-like magical manifestations visible - small clockwork creatures or floating gear-shaped energies resisting and fighting against his work. The mechanistic essence is corrupted and fighting back. Prismor straining with effort, both physical (forging) and magical (divine power trying to overcome corruption). Forge glowing bright. Dramatic forge lighting. Sense of struggle against malevolent magic.\n\nDialogue: Prismor (straining, concerned): \"It's fighting me... like the tree fought Lunara!\"\n\nSound Effects: Large bold \"CLANG CLANG\" from hammer on anvil.\n\nInclude speech bubble and sound effects clearly readable.\n\nStyle: Bold ink line art, vibrant colors, dynamic composition, sequential art style, graphic novel quality. High energy action with magical corruption effects."

His hands extended over the javelin in spell-casting gestures. CELESTIAL SYMBOLS swirling around - glowing arcane runes, star patterns, cosmic energy in silver-blue-lavender colors spiraling around the javelin. BUT - the celestial magic is CLASHING with the mechanistic essence (brass-colored gear energies from previous panel). Two types of magic fighting each other - celestial (stars, runes, cosmic) versus mechanistic (gears, cogs, metallic). Violent magical interaction - sparks, energy arcs, unstable swirls. Pocky's expression shows alarm and confusion - this shouldn't be happening. Forge glow in background.
