And there's a sheet of paper for everybody also.

Alright.

Look at my name.

So welcome everyone.

Thank you for coming and making characters and chatting with me on the phone about your characters.

Super... ...citing for me.

You are all... ...bum bum bum bum... ...at Everpeak Citadel, which looks kind of like this.

Oh, it isn't a tavern.

For the first time.

You're in a tavern and you see an old man.

What does he say?

What does he say?

Kill him now\!

Kill him now\!

Does he have a quest?

There are rats in the basement.

No.

None of that happens.

You are at Everpeak Citadel, which is a citadel in a castle that is a little more than it seems.

Everything here seems to be a little easier.

Travel seems to be lighter.

Thoughts seem to come faster.

Music plays sweeter than anywhere else.

And through one way or another, you have all made your way here for the upcoming Winter Festival.

That was yesterday.

You got the dates wrong and it is over.

The end.

Okay, so would you all like to introduce yourselves?

Or if you'd like I can...

Just read the paragraph. ...go through an intro for each of you.

I'm good with whatever.

Okay.

Jay, why don't you go ahead and introduce Pocky Winter?

My name is Pocky Winters.

I help out at the library in the castle in the citadel.

I'm a librarian.

She needs my help a lot.

I'm training to become a respected wizard.

I was knocked out of my clan up in the mountains when I was just a wee lad because I wasn't quite strong enough for them.

But I've been looking for myself, for my intelligence, instead of my brute force.

Brilliant.

Who wants to go next?

Can you read mine?

Sure.

Thank you, Tatsuki-T.

White.

Alright.

Val?

Eat it.

Val stands tall and sure-footed, his brass scales catching the morning light with a warm copper-bronze sheen.

As a courier monk raised in these mountains, there's an easy grace to his movements.

His simple robes bear the chalk marks of recent deliveries, and his kind eyes scan the festival preparations with quiet interest.

Lunara, do you want to introduce yourself?

Or do you want him to read the paragraph?

Read the paragraph.

Okay.

I'm also totally fine with you introducing yourself.

I can introduce myself.

Okay, why don't you introduce yourself, Mark?

I'm Malric.

I was raised by elves, but I was born a drow.

And recently I've found myself street performing, using my bag of tricks on the streets of whatever city we were.

Everpeak Citadel.

Everpeak Citadel.

That's how I've named my living after being raised by the elves.

I am Lunara.

I live with the current druidic group who are living in the forest.

I make my living as a guide because, you know, it's very good to be living between the two cities.

And I'm the one who's making the living.

Excellent.

And she's a cover bug because it's full of all those scum.

The dwarves.

All right.

So this year, Lunara has been tasked with bringing the living Yule Tree into Everpeak Citadel.

It's still living.

It must be alive as you can get in.

It can't be cut.

Right.

And so you've all gathered in the courtyard to see the raising of the Yule Tree, which is a tradition.

They burn it.

They raise it to the ground.

Which is a tradition every year.

They burn the tree.

Is it kind of like the horse skin?

Can we move on?

Okay.

And the winter moonlight, the winter morning air is crisp and clear as Lunara guides a magnificent living Yule Tree up the winding path toward Everpeak's main courtyard.

Despite the altitude and season, the tree should be glowing with subtle magical vitality.

And yet something seems off.

Its needles, while green, lack their usual luminescence and its branches droop slightly as if fighting against an unseen weight.

All right.

So the tree is traditionally planted in the middle of the brick courtyard and the roots go in.

One of the unusual things that occurs in Everpeak Citadel is greenery, even though you're in these high mountain ranges, seems to flourish.

Produce, trees, there's a garden cafe.

So the druids...

What's that?

I see my stuff.

Is that your equipment?

Yeah.

That's your equipment.

Where's my like...

Your billies?

No, where's my playing cards?

These are proficiencies, not my equipment.

Oh yeah, sorry.

There's all more of your papers.

Then it would be in the second page.

Guys, from Moon to Magic.

Ah, here it is.

Okay, thank you.

I don't think it would quite tell you all that stuff.

Oh, but I don't have my...

Jordan.

Yeah, because this is just like your starting equipment.

Go free to write it down.

From Moon to Magic.

So he's immune to magical.

So I'm immune to magic.

No, to magical.

There's a difference.

Exactly.

What does that mean and how did you get it?

Who knows?

Wait, can you finish explaining?

Finish.

So you're bringing the Yuletree in to set it up, and it's going to require a nature check.

Not again.

A nature check.

A skill check.

To put up the tree or to notice anything off about it?

To put up the tree.

Okay.

So Lunara is chanting the ritual.

Is there anyone in the area or like is this a large crowd that's gathered?

There is a large crowd that's gathered, yeah.

I would like to turn to the nearest person after we play a game.

Okay.

What's that?

25\.

What did you get?

Can you show me?

18\.

You got an 18 plus...

Seven.

So we're going to resolve that in a second.

While the tree is being raised up, I look over to the nearest...

All right.

Look for someone who has a little bit of money and I offer...

They would like to play a game.

Excellent.

Roll persuasion.

Do you want to play a game?

Shall we play a game?

Persuasion is...

I have proficiency in...

I'm definitely watching, so...

No?

Where am I proficiencies?

This is just all the stuff we can roll.

And it will tell you your final number there.

No, yeah, proficiency.

Okay.

I have proficiency in persuasion.

I could help.

I got a 20\.

A natural 20?

They're like, "Oh, this thing's always so boring.

I'd love to play a game.

Shall we put some money on it?"

Absolutely.

What about a wager of...

I introduced my game.

What's the economy looking like in this?

You can think that your big spenders in Las Vegas and every gold piece is $100.

Okay.

Well, let's say it's 10 gold to play. 10 gold?

Oh.

But you can win up to 25 gold.

All right, I'm in.

It's a game of dice.

So this is where the \+8 sleight of hand comes in.

Now, I explain the game and the odds to him and how he's slightly favored in this game.

Okay.

So that he is "favorite."

I roll the dice.

Okay.

I have him roll his dice first.

All right.

Should I?

Sure.

Is it d6s or...?

Just roll a d20 to see how well you do.

And then you can choose to add your sleight of hand if you want to alter the outcome.

I want him to roll it first and then I will roll my dice.

Okay, he rolls an 8 out of 20\.

He rolls an 8 out of 20\.

Okay.

Obviously the game is more complicated and there's more rules, but we're just kind of like...

Then I roll my dice with sleight of hand.

Yes.

I have 13\.

My sleight of hand is \+8.

Okay.

He rolls an insight check.

Oh, not my luck today, lad.

He gives you the 10 gold.

Okay.

Free 10 gold, boys.

A cry kind of comes up from the crowd because as Lunara is setting the tree down, the roots seem to not be going in quite as easily, but you are determined and you start chanting more and the roots are going down and you're chanting more and the roots are going down, but they seem to almost be pushing back up and you see what almost seems like this nature essence kind of pushing out and almost forming into this creature that seems upset, but then you chant a final chant and it attaches and the tree wobbles a little this way and a little this way and then the roots kind of secure it and it goes up and everyone gives kind of like a relieved...

Woo\!

Yay\!

All right.

Do you want to...

Could I please have tips, please?

You go around with your tip jar?

All right.

Roll a performance roll.

No.

Roll it.

There's no harm in rolling it.

Sure.

There actually is.

Can I ask for tips?

Woo\!

10\.

Did you do anything in the next system?

No.

I don't have anything in performance.

So you roll a 10\.

All right.

So you start going around asking for tips and one of the senior druids comes over and says, "We don't do that, lad, but here's a gold piece.

Buy yourself a chicken fritter."

Yes?

So how do you check your gold one?

He got 10 gold and he got one gold.

Assume you all have 50 gold to start with.

Okay.

So we should be tracking this somewhere.

This is not your head, so...

Okay.

Second question.

Can I start somewhere that's not the courtyard and then go down to the courtyard?

So right now we're starting.

Everyone is in the courtyard.

You might be like kind of walking down into the courtyard.

You all know each other.

You've all been good friends.

You're acquainted with each other.

You've spent time together.

You kind of enjoy hanging out with each other.

The Yule Tree is in place and now you're all free to explore EverPeak's Winter Festival.

Can I go back up to my library?

Sure.

Cool.

I'm going there.

All right.

He works at the same library that you do.

Can I roll from up, like, tripping on the stairs or something?

Or do I have to just go up from the library?

Anything that you could consider a normal person would do without rolling, you don't have to roll for.

So you can just, like, head on up.

I can walk.

So you're going to go up to the library?

Yeah.

These folks come with you or you're just going by yourself.

I don't know.

Are you anti-social is the question.

No.

What do you do at the library?

Do you work there with the other, like, sages?

Well, it's the festival today, so there's not as much going on in the library as there might usually be.

I don't think the library is part of the festival, right?

It's down at the...

I mean, everything is kind of connected.

You know, everything is dressed up a little bit for the festival.

Then I find somewhere to go help set up, like, different...

I think it's...

Sorry.

What's our goal now that we have the tree up?

So now that the tree is up, the festival is happening.

So there's lots of things going on.

Could I try to identify, of pure knowledge, what was that nature spirit?

Yeah, absolutely. 14 plus...

21\.

Add your nature?

Seven.

Okay.

So you know that in the area of Everpeak Citadel, there's additional kind of magical essences that seem to help out.

And you're used to, when you perform druidic magic or do things like this tree ceremony, like, it's like the whole...

The castle itself and the land around it is, like, helping you.

And normally that's like a wind at your back.

But this time when you tried to put the yule tree down, it was almost like the wind was blowing in your face and you were struggling against it.

And it was almost like that struggle was kind of...

The essence itself was taking form as if something was happening.

Yes.

But what was basically the creature?

And what was your roll?

What did you get total?

21\.

21\.

Okay.

Yeah, it's 10 to 10 to 10\.

You believe that it's some kind of an elemental essence, turned physical form.

Earth, nature, earth, nature.

A verdant, like a verdant essence.

Okay.

So like a verdant elemental?

Yes, something like that.

Can I investigate it?

You don't want to.

You can.

So there's lots of things going on.

There's a cook-off.

There's a forge fair.

There's a lantern release.

There's a sled race.

There's music jam.

Can I go to the room?

Wait, you said there's a forge fair?

Yeah.

Like, what is that?

So it's an exhibition where artisans and blacksmiths can show off their work.

I might want to pay an old friend a visit there because I know a couple of the blacksmiths in the area.

Absolutely.

Alright.

So you wander over to the forge fair and you see kind of a gruff bearded drow there that you know well.

Malric, it's good to see that you made it to the fair today.

Are you having fun?

I'm having a wonderful time so far.

What's his name?

Barth.

Barth, yes.

So today we're doing a little bit of an activity.

I don't know if your friends might be interested.

We've set up a forge here and you could make a hinge or an item and enjoy the natural power of the surroundings to help you construct things.

Sounds wonderful.

Hello.

The problem is I noticed during the yule tree ceremony, the nature was fighting against putting the yule tree in so it might not help you.

Oh, you know, today it hasn't been going as well as I usually find it.

Normally you could take someone who didn't know their left from their right and they'd make something fine.

But today some of these have been failing.

We need more info.

No, it recently took form and tried to push against the yule tree going in.

Things happen, I know by this, that not good things are happening.

Shall I try my luck at a weapon?

Yes, you can either use athletics if you're leaning into it with your strength to hammer properly or dexterity if you want to assemble something with smaller gears.

I would like to assemble a...

I've been running quite low on javelins recently.

I'd like to try my work at assembling the tip of the javelin.

Oh, excellent, excellent.

That would be strength, so an athletics check for that.

Here, I'll get you some materials.

Now, if you were to make a magical version of this, we would use frozen iron, which is what we use for the most powerful artifacts that we build here.

But I don't seem to have it here anymore.

That's odd.

Well, here, you can just make a regular one.

It gives you a set of irons, sets you up at the forge and the billows, and you can roll an athletics check.

Can I investigate this?

Wait, what's your investigation?

I think that Max was going to investigate the yule tree.

What's the difference in investigation?

Plus six, plus five.

Jasper?

Plus two.

He has a high-end one.

Should I roll to see where to go?

I got an 11 plus one, so 12\.

Okay.

I'm just going to try to find that frozen iron.

I'm just taking notes here.

You can't do an investigation check to find it, but you can do an investigation check to investigate things about the fact that it isn't where it should be.

Are there any big...

He's working on this thing now, but once he's done with making his jattel, I will...

All right, so you start pounding and there's something guiding your hand, but it seems like every other strike it's helping you and every other strike it's against you.

You feel this flow.

That's odd, lad.

Normally, you would expect to make something quite good.

This is the Dawnforge anvil and very worrisome.

Barth, do you feel that your cold iron, crossed iron, could have been stolen?

Well, normally that's not a thing that would happen here.

I mean, everyone here is quite trustworthy, but it does appear that I'm a little bit low and I thought it might have just been me.

Keep an eye out.

All right.

May I?

Thank you.

Oh.

I've been known for my investigative skills.

I'd be sure to help you figure out if it has been displaced or not.

Absolutely.

Yes, yes, please do.

By that I mean I got a one.

Aha\!

I believe that he has stolen your cold iron.

You can't really figure out what's going on.

You start digging through his stuff and throwing stuff behind you and where there's like, "Never mind, lad.

Can you just put the stuff back in?"

Sorry, I'm usually very explicit.

May I?

Sorry to cause you trouble.

I'm going to investigate.

I have a twelve.

I think perhaps you should take a step back.

I will take care of my things here.

Does he actually buy stuff?

He's Barth alone for a second.

Yeah, let's save his Barth.

I'll call him Barth.

Max, what would you like to do?

What?

Is there anything you would like to do?

I don't know what I can do.

I haven't really done this yet.

Yeah, no problem.

You can do whatever, basically.

I'm going to put my little shack in the woods.

Normally in an adventure the players kind of stay together because if you go off and do one thing, he goes off and does something completely different.

If you want to go to the library in the woods?

I don't know.

I don't really know what to do.

Okay.

Well, so some of the things that you can do.

There is a cook-off.

There's the Forge Fair, which you were at talking with Barth.

Later tonight there's a lantern release.

So people are making and crafting lanterns that are, you know, they've got candles in them and so they raise up into the air.

There's a sled race that's starting soon and there's a musical jam session in the song hall courtyard.

Can you wait a second?

I want to hear what Max has to say.

The sled race.

Yeah.

Okay.

Absolutely.

So is there any money placed on the sled race?

So roll a insight check.

I'd like to join him.

Okay.

I'm just coming.

All right.

Yep.

Roll the d20 and add four.

Nine.

Okay.

So 12 and a 13\.

You do know that while there's no money officially placed on the races, it's quite the culture in this area to bet on things.

And so there are there are certainly people that seem to be like they're looking you over and kind of trying to decide how good are the sleds?

The sleds are quite good.

They're very nice.

And you also know that the sled, are they forced on or are they just like sledding?

They're just gravity sleds.

How many rules are there for the race?

You know that the halflings, the halfling couriers run this race and the sled paths tend to be faster than they might normally be and more sure than they normally be.

What are the rules for the sled race?

One of the hey, there are cookies.

They appeared.

Thank you, Dan.

Insight is like for I examine the successful contestants.

Yes.

It would be an investigation.

If they look more dexterous or strong for the winners, are they are they heavier?

Are they are the winners halflings?

Roll a perception check.

Hey, Rob, could I please?

I got my perception.

Can you wait one second here?

But I have proficiency.

Do I roll two and put a better number now?

That would be advantage.

How does proficiency work?

It just adds plus two to your score.

Okay, so I got a final 13\.

Okay, so one thing you notice is that a number of the contestants who are coming back up the hill from the finish look like they're a little bit bruised.

Like they kind of ran into something.

Maybe like a sled went through a thicket that kind of thing, you know, not like terribly harmed.

Val, one of the halflings that you know comes up and he's like, Val, Val, Val, Val, Val, Val.

By the foothills this race today.

Crazy.

I don't know what went wrong.

Maybe it's because Tinderfoot, Quickfoot set the runes, but they don't seem to be working quite as well as they usually do.

Do you have any snacks?

Oh, thank you.

Just be a little careful out there.

But did you say runes or R-U-N-E?

Yeah, that's what it said.

Like the chalk runes we use in the courier tunnels.

What do these runes control like?

You know, give me a history check.

This one's pretty easy.

History, funny, not that.

You know from your time with the couriers that they're able to deliver packages and messages much faster than normal.

And part of that is because there's a series of tunnels under the castle.

But part of it is also because there's chalk runes up on the wall.

And when you go along the routes that are chalked out, you just seem to go much faster.

Similarly, cargo that's carried up from the bottom of the mountain, even though it has to go up this really steep hill, it doesn't seem like the horses are tired out and it seems to go much more smoothly.

So you think that the halflings have used these runes to augment and enhance the sled route to make it more exciting.

So I want to take a piece of chalk from my backpack and draw more of these runes on the sled, but it go faster.

You can certainly try.

Like you're not an expert in the runes and they don't really trust you with the chalk.

But you do happen to have kind of taken a piece of chalk and you've been studying the runes a little bit.

What could go wrong?

While Val is doing this, I turn to one of the spectators watching and ask him if he'd like to place a wager on this next race.

I would like to place a wager.

What do you think?

Big one?

Little one?

My money's on this one.

Ha\!

That one.

Yeah, I'll take your bet there.

Alright, let's place five gold.

What do you say?

Oh, big spender.

Can I do something?

He kind of walks over to you and kind of feels your muscles and kind of looks at you and looks at the other one.

It's a deal.

Can I say that if I intentionally screw up the race, it's going to give me a cut of the money?

Oh\!

I don't know.

What do you think?

Wait, what if you bet a wager that this one will be in one's place?

Wait, no.

So what we should do is you said five gold that he wins.

Now, what you should do is go to the guy that he was wagering with and say, "Hey, I'll intentionally screw up this race for ten gold."

Wait, that means losing five gold.

Exactly.

But he wouldn't agree to that.

That's just an instant lose five gold.

I'll tell you what.

If you screw up the race and Val wins, I'll give you three of my five gold.

Deal.

If he doesn't win, I'll give you nothing.

No.

You'll take three gold.

If you don't win, your pocket might feel a little light later in the day.

May I do something?

Sure.

You might black out, wake up in the sewer, keep your purse on.

I was going to ask him if I could make a magic enhancing rod.

Well, he doesn't have the magic.

He's low.

Sorry.

Who can make what?

If I can try to make a magic enhancing rod, I'd say cool frost dire.

He was out.

Oh, back at the forge.

He said he was low, not out.

But low would be enough that he couldn't make a javelin tip.

Javelin tips are pretty small.

He would roll the perspitum into giving you...

So you go back to Barth.

We'll do the sled race in a second.

So you're back at the forge.

Why don't you roll a persuasion check?

I'll just roll a persuasion check for 20 gold.

That is a lot.

You get advantage.

Actually, how about we play five gold on that side?

Okay.

You still have advantage.

How much does he need for advantage?

He gets to roll two dice and choose the highest number.

Can I have a pressure plus run, please?

Just roll it. 19 and five.

So I take 19\.

What a generous druid you are.

I'll take that into the forge funds and we'll be sure to spend it on something very important.

Maybe tonight at the pub.

Anyways, here is some iron and there's the forge.

Take hammers and pliers.

Whatever you need.

What is it to make this rod?

I just want to place one on every magic stuff.

Just ask for the pepper.

That's a rather difficult creation.

Yes, but would you like five gold to do it for me?

Of course.

I'm just letting you know that one is a bit challenging and usually we would use the main forge with all of the enhancements.

Go ahead.

Why don't you?

No, that's beautiful.

You can use...

What does he get?

You're going to use... it's going to be two rolls.

There is an athletics roll to do the forging.

And then there's going to be an arcana roll to try to do the magic.

So it is an athletics?

I always like to help my friends.

I can help you with the enhancing of magic if you'd like.

Ooh, little guidance.

No, I would just enhance the magic.

My arcana is plus seven.

Wait, how does this work?

You can attempt to help him.

Do I add those?

No, this skill determines this number.

So starting with the athletics check.

I paid five gold actually.

Just keep going.

Roll the first one at minus one.

Ten.

Minus one, it's a nine?

No, it was an eleven minus two.

So ten.

You have a very basic rod shape.

It's a stick.

It's not that good.

So as you're kind of hitting, it seems like it's harder than usual.

In this kind of gear-like kind of visuals.

I just do a...

Twenty-two.

What's that?

Twenty-two.

For the arcana.

Twenty-two for the arcana.

Alright, so...

Let's go back to the betting on Sludger.

As you try to assemble the arcana, as you're hitting it, these kind of gear-like elements are kind of pushing back out.

And then as you try to enchant it, there's these kind of celestial star-like things that keep swirling around, and you're just kind of trying to cram them in there.

And you cram them in and cram them in, and you end up with a rod of guidance that gives you plus one on any skill check.

But you need to roll a d20, and if you get a one, it will explode.

Can I try to enhance this?

You did.

That was the roll.

That was.

No, enhance the...not explode it.

Enhance the enhancement?

I don't think you can do that.

Yeah, you've enhanced the enhancement.

You managed to kind of squash the celestial energy into it and kind of almost like wrapped the equivalent of twine around it and tied it shut.

Okay, so back in the sled races, you're trying to put runes on the sled to make it go even faster.

So you pull out your courier's chalk, look around a little bit, make sure no one's looking, and you start scrawling the equivalent of an elementary school kid drawing a dragon on the sled.

That would be...

So you can use arcana or sleight of hand?

I'm going to go for sleight of hand.

16\.

Total?

Yes.

Okay, so it seems like the sled wants to kind of jump forward underneath you.

That's good.

And you've got advantage on this race.

Okay.

Alright, the quick foot, one of the quick foot halflings.

So you position yourself kind of nearest someone you think is going to be the fastest, and then during the race you'll be able to roll an athletics check to see if you can kind of like nudge someone off the path.

Oh, so I can take out the competition.

Right, exactly.

So the guy who's betting on this guy, you're going to kind of like nudge him off the race.

Oh, he didn't bet on me.

Okay, good.

Okay, so one of the quick foot half leans against the front and he's like zip-zap zip-zap zip-zap zip-zap zip-zap zip-zap and the three to go go go go go And they drop a rope and all the sleds start down yours seems to leap forward Roll a d20 athletics you get to roll advantage.

Oh Yes, the \-1 athletics check world go with it Or you can use sleight of hand if you want.

Oh, I'll go with What for to whichever is better Oh, they're both 17 so 21 21 Wow, okay You're trying to roll athletics Yeah six on the bottom so you go to kind of like Nudge into someone but they're just a little bit faster than you and so you end up like whoa Going a little bit behind them now halfway down the mountain.

You are cruising.

You're easily at the front You both need to make a dexterity saving throw Okay, so there's a saving throw value Yeah up here it's the equivalent of Yes Okay, it's fine um No falling off the roof Okay, so here max you have a plus one dexterity Saving throw yes, and you have a plus six You get advantage on this one as well because your sled is kind of listening to you Hello Yeah Okay, there's a 15 a 6 will go this and I get a 21 again.

Yes It's live right now Another nine Plus one yes and nine Okay, 21 21 and nine nine Yeah, all right max Your slide veers into a bunch of thorn bushes and you're able to like hold on and keep your head down But this is wild the winners, but you take a point of damage That's the as the thorns kind of tear across you and tear your cloak a little bit.

Nope Nope, you just take one point of damage there next to your 28 just right at 27 just really small Jasper does easily Steer so you're going down It looks like everything is good and then you feel like a sharp nudge to the right as if Like you know from doing your courier that sometimes when you're on the right It's like the wind in your sails like it kind of pushes you but this one is like straight sideways And so you get bashed sideways, but then you're able to kind of Bring the sled back around and you can feel your room kind of pulling you in the direction that you want to go You zoom across the line There's like Suspicious kind of sparks and things flying off the back of your Shock also, I don't ram into the wall.

Okay The guy looks at you and is like Roll persuasion He only got a seven total so he's like funny things happening with the essences these days and he counts out one two three four five All right Sixty five gold now.

Oh smokes.

So what that's so what don't you have to pay me?

Oh, yes You didn't do anything though I'll give you two gold.

No, cuz if you don't I'll tell them what happened We don't I mean Fine I'll give you your three gold My persuasion is a plus four so So Val as you cross the line, there's a Sandy haired young halfling child waiting and he looks at you Wide-eyed as he looks at all of the sparks coming off of the back of the thing.

He goes Oh, wow That's a really fast sled Can I see your sled?

Can I use your sled for the next one that looks amazing.

I haven't seen sleds like that in a long time Oh golly Thanks He like grabs the sleigh which is almost as big as he is and he starts like heading up the hill with it to do the next run The runes are both delights and bad It's just a normal one But he might happen He's a halfling So he believes and all of a sudden it happens Could be could be all right They are quite lucky All right, where else would you like to do?

What else is happening?

Anything else outside Anything else outside?

I mean there's people there's people around like people are sitting and chatting There's little food booths where you can eat food There's like a Snow sculpture cider drinking Mary bells Okay Yeah So what did you want to do Bryce?

I was going to go to the weird garden Where magical things seem to happen And we might May or may not go into like 15 Combats because demons Summon like some house spawn Angels spawn You know the whole nine yards I don't know if we're going to be fighting angels As the halfling boy walks away he's like Demons?

We haven't had those here in a hundred years Kind of goes back up the hill What do you want to do?

I think carnival games Except the protection from evil good things I think that the I think that I would be pretty intrigued by the strange happenings I I I I may Hike a bit back up to the Library And try and You know I kind of know my way around I might try and find Some sort of book on those verdant spirits Okay That they were talking about Assuming Assuming you shared that information with the party yet Yep Awesome Let's go kill the evil I know Aw dang it As we walk there I kind of Search along the streets for anyone who may be Kind of struggling at that time And I give 20 silver To that kind of street person Because I personally had been in that experience before I Learned my arcana And 20 silver is just too gold I know It sounds bigger So you hand out silver as you go And people are oh thank you thank you Do you also look for the rich folks Streading their way through the city I've already made 12 gold Why don't you Why don't you So you're going up to the citadel Sorry you're going up to the library to do research Bryce You would like to go to the cafe To Maryville's cafe Is there anything strange going on Oh you have to go there to hear that Max what was it that you wanted to do You said there was a cooking competition There is a cook off Yeah I was just asking what other events are Currently happening I mean it's a big fair so there's lots of stuff going on Where can we go gambling Let's go gambling What are the rooms in this There's a library There's a forge There's the Observatory The ballroom is the Song hall courtyard That's where there's a dance off and a musical jam going on Does anyone know a musical instrument Ummm Do you know the learner musical instrument I think you play the bagpipes Yes I play the bagpipes Because that's a good idea You have found that when you are standing in the song hall Your bagpipes sound amazing In a way they do And people are lucky to hear you When you go back to your monastery where there is a vow of silence And you attempt to play them there For some reason It just doesn't come out quite the same And it's not appreciated in the same way Exactly Does anyone else have a musical instrument Ummm I have the fireball You get a fireball You get a fireball I don't play music No it's not a question of whether or not you play music I was persuaded into not seeking a musical instrument I was persuaded into not seeking a musical Reficiency Max Where would Prismore like to go Maybe up to the library with With Pocky I know but Wait He could do tricks to the bagpipe music So So You definitely think that The folks at the Timber Oak Archive might know More about What's going on Is Timber Oak Archive the library That's the library in the woods The library in the woods I'll go there So you'd like to go there So you'd like to go to the Timber Oak So you overhear Pocky A.K.A Apocalypse Winter Talking about how he's thinking of going up to the Celestial Library In the castle to do some research And you think that there might be more information About this nature situation at the Timber Oak Archive Check both And then meet up somewhere Let's find out And then you wanted to I was going to ask Kirsten do you have any tricks you could do To bagpipe music I can always throw on a show Wherever He can use his wand and make your bagpipe music better Probably And or explode Let's go with that I might actually wild chape Put on a performance That's a cool idea Do anything Wild chape into a dancing bear To dance along with your bagpipe music To dance along with bagpipes Or I could probably turn into like A dancing bear Dancing bears funny I can accompany I could probably turn into a Moraga snake Prismar I can accompany Prismar towards his library Okay Alright so First let's go up to Marybel's Coffee shop So the coffee shop Is an unusual place In the middle of the Castle And there's a bunch Of different herbs and produce Growing all around The head Let's see Where is Marybel Um Ah Lunara Welcome dear What's that?

Oh Uh No we have had A few new visitors Who are not quite as lovely As most of our Guests are Certainly not as lovely as you The bloom on a flower The petal in the rain Would you like your Usual Yes I would like my triple shot Espresso Here is your triple shot espresso Infused with leaves Of well I would Put lavender in but the lavender isn't Growing quite as well as it should Hmm I'll use cardamom Here you are Okay I like the sound of that Hmm Hmm How is your Festival going for you Lunara?

I heard you had trouble With the yule tree?

Yes so there was There seemed to be a Magician A badened spirit or Elemental I don't really Know which but It is strange It is almost Like the Magic that you The everyday magic That Helps you do day to day Tests like You know making Coffee and You know Keeping the pesky Keeping the pesky no books Out or All of That magic seems to Not work Hmm So interesting I do believe that The nature resonates With the natural ley lines of Natural essence in this area And there has been some disturbance There Yes happened to me Hmm I happen To also know that we happen to That this entire castle Is on the Vege of two Ley lines It sits right where they cross Oh indeed It does seem that you You did mention a noble dearie Yes Yes the very pesky annoying one That keeps on coming here There did seem to be one that came through with some New drow Oh that's not good That came through They said they were diplomats but they didn't Seem very diplomatic to me Did they Kind of seem like a war party What were you doing What was I doing Yeah there was some drow that came through What were you up to That's a little bit racist I don't see that all drow I was just wondering if he was in the party They sat and Had a Whiskey sardine Cocktail and Seem to be discussing something About Keys or lenses Or an alignment I didn't catch very much Would you like a warm up dearie No thank you I'm good Okay What I will say is that Did they have a whole bunch of Weapons and equipment currently On them You should investigate Yeah why don't you roll an investigate Sure I'm trying to see whether or not we have a War party inbound Or not We have a 17 They did See more the Adventure types This is Maryabelle's Cafe Is it night time Not right now but this picture was taken At night They have photos in medieval times Precisely Or actually The magic painters in boxes Because that's how you actually take photos So you're the only one at this Coffee shop Or at the beast you are I think the whole group came up to the coffee shop Oh okay So it's a group of drow Can I also help investigate Yeah you can roll an investigate To help out Yes it was a noble with Three drow I've never seen here Normally it's just Your loveliness and Barth such a sweetheart comes up here For cocoa nearly every night These three seemed Hmm A little more bitter or angular Is there any way that I would know These drow You do not know these drow I see Can you describe the noble Umm Uhh The noble was Uhh He seemed very insulting Fashionable but maybe a Subtly militaristic Coat He kind of had his chin up All the time Is it the figure of one that comes Around here every once in a while No should never see them before Not one of the Usual nobles That I see around here I think maybe he's up for the Festival like many of the others Did you see where they were heading Hmm I did not So Can I Roll to get down to hell faster So I don't miss the party The party is going on like all day long For the specific one of the Cause there was an earlier party Oh which one Did you want to go to The secret spot in the woods Oh Oh the umm The oak tree The timber oak archive rather Umm We'll get there in a minute Okay so you visited the cafe Talked to Maryville Talked to Barth You were considering Jordan The timber oak archive You mean the thing that there's a trap door to Here just go through this Doesn't matter Yeah there's weird trap doors There's weird passages in the coffee shop But Maryville prefers if you Don't if you don't use those She's like We don't talk about those Is Malrec still coming Yeah Malrec is With us everyone is kind of together So if you want to go down to the Timber oak archive to see if you can figure out Speed ruins Waa Draw them on your backpack And then I haven't quite worked out all the details But I'm pretty sure this will get us there faster Draw them on the like Poops you know Can you draw some on my tree You do know some passages through the Through the Underground corridors Where's kind of the cafe like in relation to everything The cafe is kind of in this weird In the middle of the center of the citadel Like once you get in there it's almost like You're in this unused central area So it's kind of just like Up here and we need to get out the gate And over towards Out the gate down the hill and in towards here Everyone will have to put blindfolds on Why Why Because I'm not supposed to show you this Well we're the close Yeah but I'm not sure They're going to want me to show you this So you're going to toss blindfolds on And link hands and we're going to But see I'm Just going to swipe away Wait so am I aware of some of the Passages and ways Around the city Roll history What equipment do I use Can I roll history too because I have a high history Intelligence I have a \+4 history can I roll that I have a \+3 history But I'm also using my like I'm in an underbelly of the city For \+4 I have two Final five Never Never such a thing Were you storing Whether or not you're aware of the courier tunnels underneath the city Well wouldn't Jasper know about him A little bit He's the one who suggested He's suggesting that he take you through the tunnels But he doesn't I don't really care if I know about them or not He's taking it to the side Can I roll a history check It's in the back You don't have any Do any of you happen to have a dagger 9 \+ 4 Yeah you've heard of these tunnels Beneath the Beneath the castle I know like general directions You're vaguely aware that The halfling couriers Somehow find a way to get from one side of the city Much faster than anybody else can And everyone suspects that Maybe they have some way of getting But you don't know exactly I'm on board with going Everyone's going to be Blindfolded Can I do a sneaky check Nobody knows 14 Take it to the What is your sleight of hand \+1 15 bubble He wants to peek through the blind He peeks through the blind He got a 13 He got a 14 The tunnel's open What a sneaky thing So you head down into the tunnels Which look kind of like this They're kind of messy Except most of that's chalk And it's like slightly more straight So you start heading down the tunnels And you quickly go down the first stretch But then when you move to the second stretch Suddenly you find yourself back at the first stretch again I get quite impatient I do too And you're like no, no So you go down the first stretch And then you try a different And then you end up back at the first stretch again I'm going to try something I'm going to shoot A produced flame I'm going to shoot a produced flame To see whether or not it's Teleportation or not What's going on I'm going to start getting suspicious Of what's going on and wondering why it's going on So you shoot your flame Down and you see it disappear And then suddenly go this way And then come from behind you And it almost hits you as it goes forward And then hits a post I take off my blindfold You can see these tunnels All around you with scrawled Runes and roll me a perception My perception is Plus four Total five Sorry, sorry, final nine Yeah, you're You're just kind of taking it all in You've heard of these places but you've never been here So you're kind of soaking it up Everyone is looking at you though What's going on So as Lunar has demonstrated There seems to be something amiss With the tunnels Do you notice anything about the runes I Have I been in this part of the tunnel That worked before?

Like is this a Columnally traveled place or is this More out of the city?

Yeah, normally there's like Markings that kind of tell you where To go and you've been following the Markings but give me a perception check Could I have my own?

Five You know, you're not An expert courier And you're pretty sure this should Work Um Can someone like Why don't you give me a Investigation check Something total What's that?

Twenty, thirty Alright You think that someone has Messed with the runes?

You notice One of them seems a little smudged and where The arrow went one way it's kind of In another way I propose that we go the normal way That's what I I promise you that's what I've been trying to do I start climbing Out of the tunnel on the ladder on the side So you turn around And you move Towards where you came from where the ladder was And then you find yourself coming through the Same passage So we're stuck in Oh, no Is there like a conner roll or Something to like kind of figure out what's in this Can I throw an investigation I'm going to drop my blindfold because I don't know what's happening and I'm throwing an investigation Everyone what's happening And we get a six and a plus two so Eighteen You notice that some of the Some of the chalk marks Have been messed with a little bit Is there Any way I could try and repair Them?

Absolutely you can totally try that That would be a That would be a That would That would be an arcana Just going to remind people that I have a plus eight In arcana Wait hold on a second Give me one second Yeah I tell you everything that I Understand so far So can I take off my blindfold Yeah One second Oh you peed Let me throw another fire Produce flame but you move out of the way We did this already I don't want to lose anymore I thought we He told me we did this already Okay so You go to Redirect the lines and it seems like It's much more Than just drawing or arcana Because this is like The essence of maybe movement or displacement You have to draw on Either Acrobatics, stealth Investigation Or deception As those all Represent some aspect of Displacement I would use stealth Okay so you draw on You draw on your Ability Like when you're Stealthing you're kind of sneaking through And remaining unseen He can have as much as he wants Alright So You start chalking And you're trying to fix This thing go ahead and roll stealth I still love that stealth Uhhhh Twelve Alright it seems like It might be working and then Suddenly it seems like it's really Not working And then it's really really Not working And there are Sparks and fire That shoot out into A Nearly Invisible creature Whose edges flicker like a Mirage Each flap of its wings leaves a Shimmering after image And it seems like footsteps begin To echo from unexpected directions It turns towards you And roll initiative Wait we don't have a lap It's fine Just do it in the mind We're doing it in the mind Because it's faster like by ridiculous amounts I've got I've got an initiative of one So what I would like you to do is say your Characters name and your initiative and when I say Your characters name back to you Then you will know that I've got it Brilliant move Pocky Wait initiative Umm What's initiative Well it's 630 plus your It's up here There's an initiative right here That's your 19 dirty It doesn't matter It's only 20 Malric 11 Malric 11 thank you Lunara 19 Lunara 19 thank you I got a 60 and 30 Prismore 16 Prismore and I got A 14 for Val Val 14 And the Oh This creature goes first This creature goes first 20 30 coins It doesn't matter it's just higher 23 23 30 I want to have an 18 and wisdom Alright I have a I didn't get it Paul The creature looks kind of like this Wow It's shimmering flickering That's not good Wait so did I take any damage Nope this is just the order in which we go So initiative is just like How do we take turns and who goes first And who goes next He has not healed his point of damage How do I even heal You get better Okay Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop Alright So it looks at you and who's Closest to you right now like who is Helping with us Chalking I had not yet called for him for help I mean I figured out so I may have been Near but I don't know I imagine we're all standing close So it looks at the two of you And it It puts its fingers to its temples And a shimmering glow comes out And both of you have to make a wisdom save DC 13 12 Was it 14 So you Barely recover from Being disoriented but you are Disoriented So disoriented means that you have Disadvantage on everything Until the end of your next turn And everyone has advantage against you Until the next turn And actually let's say after I need to Excuse me What does he look like he is Like what material does he look like Kind of weird shimmering Etherish threads of light Yes but my question is is it metal or not Is it metal Is the creature made of metal Is it metallic Does not appear to be metallic I was about to say I think there's only one Spell I could think of that It involved something needing to be metal To effect it Which is And so at the end of its turn The creature Suddenly blinks out of existence And then pops up 20 feet down the corridor And now it is Lunara's turn Lunara what would you like to do So we just go in order so it's Lunara and then Prismor, Val, Malrec, Pocky So the higher your initiative The sooner in the turn you go So that was the roll we rolled at the beginning Yeah If you want to make Little Folded cards with the name of the person On it I can put them over the top of this And then you will see visually The order that they are in Alright Roll an attack You have to hit with your firebolt Well you tell me what you get And I'll tell you what happens I get a 22, 30 That is a hit So roll your damage Can I roll and do damage I picked my highest Damage thing What's firebolt 1d10 No it's a d10 9 damage 9 damage The firebolt shoots out So you were Aiming at it and then it blinked out And you turned around and went like this Because the firebolt Was like just about to come off Your fingers like you couldn't pull it back Like you hit a 180 And then And it tears through the essence And it burns and the thing seems to Shriek and look at you With menace Prismor How much hit points does this thing have?

You don't know How much did it lose?

It looks like it's quite injured Is it bloodied?

It It's made of like this Strands of ethereal light It's hard to say I know what that means Roll a perception check You don't know You have to tell the Celestial creatures how You feel On a scale from 1 to 32 How are you feeling?

Sparkly?

I do a 20, 30, 30 You think it's done some Significant damage to it Is it bloodied or not?

Bloodied, yes Prismor, what would you like to do?

It's about 20 feet down the hall from you So how far apart are the teleporters?

You don't know Oh, like how far do you go down before you start coming around the other side?

Like hundreds of feet Yeah, so it's still in the hallway Yeah, it's a large area It's a large area I'll look at both sides maybe So you can see that Wait, can I have a continuity reason Why these magic portals are happening?

Can I see the picture of the tunnels?

Hold on please I'd like to use medicine to cure myself Because we're going in the middle of the tunnel I'd like to use medicine to cure myself Because we're going into combat So if you spend your whole round doing that You might be able to It's a heal a single point Or you can back from over the head But you have a lot of hit points You have 28 hit points And you're down to 27 So you probably don't need to heal right now So you might choose to try to You could try to attack it with your sword Kill it Are there any other things I could do to help?

Kill it Most probably the best thing you could do Is attack this creature Yeah, so you run at it Raise your greatsword In two hands You could breathe your breath weapon You could absolutely use ray of frost You could absolutely use ray of frost It's more damage It's more damage Thank you No, that's the hit No, that's the hit But it'd be more likely Oh, can you write the names on the back as well?

But Max, that would be Way more damage It might be better to hit though than to deal damage Because at this point it seems very damaged So maybe guaranteeing a hit It actually can't Wait, let's use I'd like to use poison spray Which is going to be a higher Because it's a 1v12, not a v8 But you still get the blood sticks That's a saving throw, right?

That's a saving throw, right?

No, that's just one of my Weapon attacks and cantrips It's a cantrip, and I think you have to be What's the range on it?

I have no idea what that means Wait, what does it say?

Look on the final page Correct this if this is wrong No, frismor, Val, malaric bucket Good memory Hey, he can hit 30 feet It's 30 feet And it's 20 feet Wait, so on the final page Where does it Look for poison breath as your cantrip Poison spray Has 30 feet And the creature is 20 feet from him So you can hit It's 20 feet So hold on one second I'll read it out loud for you guys Poison spray is a level 0 cantrip It has a range of 30 feet You spray toxic mist At a creature within range Make a ranged spell attack against the target On a hit, the target takes 1d12 poison damage No saving throw But it is to hit So you need to make a ranged spell attack Against the target So it's d20 plus your Spell casting modifier plus your proficiency Spell casting modifier It's wisdom because You are a paladin Hold on one second, Bryce Plus 4 wisdom And then what is your proficiency Poison spray It says plus 6 to hit Which is the plus 4 plus 2 proficiency So roll a d20 Add No idea One second Jasper, can you pause for a second I want to explain to Max Bryce, I need you to pause for a minute Because I want to explain to Max So when you use a spell Or an ability, there's different ways to determine Whether it hits or not.

Something hits automatically Something like you have to steer it into the creature Some things are in effect that the creature Is going to try to resist Like if you tried to cast sleep on something It would try to resist that So different spells have different things This spell you need to hit So you're rolling a dice to see If you hit the creature with your Poison spray The range is 30 feet so it's not very far But this thing is only 20 feet down the hall from you So you're able to hit it So you kind of enchant up And then you go And this poison mist Toxic mist sprays out And envelops it And so you're going to roll a d20 Plus 6 Plus 6 Okay And that is enough to hit the creature And so you're going to do 1d12 Poison damage, so the big chonker Yep Yes Oh It's dead We don't know if it's dead though Alright, the creature Shrieks and dissolves And there's kind of like this The kind of The kind of celestial Light appears to coalesce Back on the rune and then the rune fades And is now gone Someone drew ruin I did not draw Am I still next in the initiative order?

Yes you are Or Val is Is there one more time I can do So you're done in the combat So with this there's no more creatures on the board So we're going to There's no more Creatures who appear That you are aware of That are trying to attack you So we are out of combat The rune has gone away What did you want to do?

I wanted to stealth and check for any other monsters Because it seems like it would be a relatively difficult spot Roll perception Can we Are we in the order?

Nope, we're no longer in the order Hey, um Could I see Could I see The only thing you notice is that The rune seems to have Disappeared but you do notice that there are Other runes drawn along the hallway Or is the teleporting still working?

Or does it still teleport?

If you want to walk down the hall A couple hundred feet You can just chuck a rock, right?

Sure So you chuck a rock and the rock kind of keeps bouncing down the hall Okay, so we can continue Blindfold up Can I ask Val if There's a way out of this If we run into a situation Where we're stuck in a tunnel And we're teleporting with a monster again There should not be Very convincing Okay, blindfold up again I keep my blindfold down and continue down the tunnel after that No?

Okay I'm going to blindfold up And maybe not cut somebody Whose name IRL may or may not be Jordan What?

What does Jordan have to do?

Okay Can I see the hallway?

Can you see the what?

The hallway?

The picture of the hallway?

Yeah, sure Do you have any other pictures of the wall?

No, he only had to take one picture per seat It's not going to be exactly accurate to what everything is Or the feel So I might have a cameo reason on why teleportation is in this Would you want to, when you manage to fall down there Teleport up Right You wouldn't want to fall down any So it could be a normal thing?

Well I don't think it's a normal thing But I think it could be a malfunctioning part It's like a malfunctioning normal part Is it going to be investigation or arcana?

Arcana probably I just created the reason that it makes sense My investigation was pretty good but I'll go with arcana That's a 15 You seem to think that looking at a couple of the smudge runes They're trying to lead you away from something specific I tried with everything going on and it starts heading down the corridor towards where we were previously going I would love to Do I know where the runes are trying to stop you from going?

It seemed like they were trying to stop you from going straight ahead And when you get to the end It seems like they're trying to keep you from going to the right And which direction is the library?

The library is to the left It seems like these malevolent spirits are trying to keep us from going a certain direction How about one of you comes with me and we can figure out if there's anything that we can stop?

Malor is already at the crossroads Which direction are you going?

He looks at his trusty set of dice And he rolls even left and odd right Okay Odd He turns to the right Looks back at his friends And starts jogging to the right Malor and I will go that way I will try and follow them to make sure they don't get lost in the winding tunnel I will be fine my friend So you turn to the right And you're walking forward And up ahead you can see this mural And it looks like there's something shiny there But the more you walk the slower you get Good idea you're on the right Yes Can I look for more runes that might look off from alternative malor spirit guys?

Sure, roll perception That's going to be 14 There is a glowing rune in the shape of a net Lovely Guys Then I have a Do not worry my friend You're speaking way too quickly I'm not in the slow one yet He started jogging I'm walking I'm way behind him I would love to give it a Let's see Fireball Let's give it a I'm going to cast magic missile Wait that's a cantrip?

On the glowing rune It is not a cantrip it is a first level spell Well then why don't you just use fireball?

Because magic missile cannot miss And I am intent on hitting these creatures because I know they are elusive and might run away I have magic missile too Alright so you zap the rune with magic missile It bursts into sparkles Which form into two more of these creatures In front of you Are we at the crossroads already?

Surely at a disadvantage from initiative Or am I not in the comp?

As soon as the rune comes off you find yourself like loosened up Where are we in the crossroads?

Have we gotten there?

We've all turned right like I turned right to sell you Roll initiative Malric 11 You will use your initiative to decide if you want to leave or go forward but you still need to roll initiative You can go to the left towards the other area 19 for Val Val 19 thank you Initiative 16 16 Prismore thank you Pocky 22 Pocky 22 I can't possibly get a 20 Lunara 6 thank you And the wee sparkly beasties roll to 1 plus 3 So they are last Val got above Prismore 19 Pocky got the highest Malric got an 11 Before or after Prismore?

After 16 After Prismore and before Lunara Pocky After Prismore I'm going to They seem very upset with you They look similar to the last one Yes Nearly invisible creature Edge is flickering like a mirage As it flaps its wings there's like shimmering after the image is coming off of it It seems like I have seen invisibility but I don't think that would have to be teleporting So I don't think it would, like it could help a little bit but I don't think it would help enough to justify using it Do we think they're teleporting or just becoming invisible and moving quickly?

Good question I'm not sure I think either way they're still very nimble creatures and I think we're in our best interest to Just try and hit them instead of making it slightly easier to hit them because I don't think it would do too much just to see their invisibility I will say just get past them It seems like they have a certain restriction on their range on where they move because they would naturally be blinded They can run faster than we can So is there anything below silver?

Binded where?

To the ruin You mean the ruin that's not gone?

Oh my god we did that again It was slowing down Malorak so I destroyed the room Yeah let's see, and do any of the other magical missiles bolts find their target or do they all just crash into the wall?

I mean all of them crash straight into the room and kind of zap it, kicking up a bunch of chalk dust which then coalesced into these two creatures What color was it glowing?

Blue Okay so I will...

I may just try and hit them with a poison spray I'll hit the left one say Okay These ones look like that Oh they're a little different than the last ones A little bit different, I mean very similar Do they still have wings?

They still have wings Oh okay That's going to be a 3 which is a 9 To hit?

Yes 9 is insufficient, okay Val Prismar you're up next Val I will...

Have anything that we've done that's like physical actually hit them?

Or is it all magic that's hit them?

So far you've only used magic, you haven't done any physical Okay so you don't know whether or not Just use magic Like martial combat would be good Correct, you do not know that So...

Is there anything I can do?

What's my breath weapon?

It's fine I guess but what does that do?

What are you?

Dragon March Oh you're also Dragon March But where would it do?

What do you have so much money to do at the moment?

He kind of min-matched his thing No I had a lot of decks And some of the skills are based on decks Whereas you have skills based on wisdom better Breath weapon You can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy Fire When you take an attack action in return you can replace one attack with a breath weapon And you can also use it to do a lot of damage Okay so I'm going to show you Fire, when you take an attack action in return you can replace one attack with a breath weapon That is a 15 foot cone or a 30 foot lime that is 5 feet wide Choosing the shape each time Each creature must make a DC 12 deck saving throw taking 1d10 fire damage on a failed save or half on a success Is this a spell slot?

This is a breath weapon that I may use 2 times per long rest Okay Is Pocky still confused after that first attack?

Good question, the confusion kind of wore off Okay That's good But you're feeling a little bit like hungover Let's see Okay That was why I mistressed Nothing to do with my aim Exactly So I'm just going to make it happen now Yes, I will make the breath weapon Okay With a DC 12 Okay Alright So it's just I roll a saving throw against it?

Yes, for a DC 12 What's, DC 12 what?

Decks, sorry Okay, DC 12 decks It got an 11, 12, 13, 14 So is that half damage?

Yes And the damage is That die So I roll a 15 over here D10 So 3 damage 6 over 2 And it is a 15 foot clone So does it hit both of them?

Yes, both of them You do catch both of them The second one also saves Okay, so both of them take 3 Sorry Paging, paging, paging Paging, paging, paging Alright Next up Pryzmoor Pryzmoor You are up Pryzmoor There's a few things I want to try Okay So, do you have anything to do with archery?

I think that'd be fun Yeah, absolutely, you can shoot an arrow This is my great sword The great sword is a sword The long bow The long bow is a bow So archery is when you shoot a bow and arrow Yeah, I know, but can I pick one of those to use?

You can run at it with your great sword Or Or you can fire your bow So I can use those The archery bonus that you have only works on your bow Not on your sword You can do either of them, yes Which one do you think would be better?

You're pretty good with your sword If you're close enough to hit something with your sword I have graze You have what?

Yeah, and you have graze Even if you miss You still do damage, correct Okay, you give a great Paladin battle cry You pull forth your two-handed Sword and you charge At this blinking flickering Abomination So roll to hit, you roll a d20 You add your Okay, plus, what's your Bonus to hit?

If you look down below See where it says great sword Okay, Bryce, please So you take the roll You add that plus five And that's a ten You miss, but because you have graze You still do Damage The amount of damage that you do I think has to do with Hey Jordan, how much damage do you from graze?

From graze, I believe it's your modifier Okay, so what is your strength?

My strength modifier This is me I know, I'm just looking This is me Bryce Thank you, Bryce So what's your strength modifier?

Plus three Okay, so you do Even though you miss You're still able to correct your swing And it shears through And it looks like it kind of slices through some of these things But it doesn't look like it does as much Damage as you would have hoped for Okay Oh, I can't do anything else Yeah, Malrec Is that one actually I try to get in the mind of this creature And pull the dead Oh And I do this on the one that The more damaged one?

The more damaged one Pull the dead?

Is it a, it's just a saving throw?

It's a DC13 wisdom DC13 wisdom Okay, it does not make that What was that?

I'll get it Don't ask questions There's like things that just fall down into the walls all around here So So you're able to get it Okay, so if it's a damaged creature It is damaged Yep, you do 1d12 Um I deal 6 damage Nice Alright, so necrotic Necrotic glow comes up around it And it's almost like arms are trying to tear it down into the earth To its damnation Nice But it's still up and It's still up and running Lunara You're our last best hope before the baddies go Get fired Alright, fire bolt Probably the more damaged one Um, I do I do a Rather This is yours Yes, it's a Um I do a 24 24 is a hit For sure Can I say something?

Wait, can I check Like how high their AC is?

Can you figure out how high their AC is?

Uh, no Um, but See guys, their AC is less than 24 And this is valuable Exactly It's more than a 9 It's more than a 10 Actually I got a 10 with my modifier Wow, that's only a 14 Point range 10 and 24 I do 5 damage Is the dead one dead?

Is the dead one dead?

Is the fire bolt Is the fire bolt a d10 or d8?

Fire bolt is a d10 Um, I do 5 points of damage It is Holding on by a thread Like how much HP?

Like a thread's worth of HP However A thread is enough For both of them facing you Looking at you Oh, oh Uh, facing you to No Pearl Crystalline fragments of warped space That seem to bend light around them at yours It's like jagged Shards of transparent crystal Um, correct Oh, so this is the first time we're seeing Yes, so the first one Gets an 8 To hit One gets a natural 20 By natural 20, I think you mean 6 I'm going to use a portent roll From the beginning of my day To change any attack or ability check Or same throw to one of my previous rolls You're like warping space and time, that's my jam Exactly So you do like a little bit of judo on it And like the probability wave just flows Around you without affecting you Which is probably a good thing Alright So, because I am a divination wizard What I can do is At the beginning of every day I roll 2 d20s And then I save those rolls And then I can turn any other roll Into that value And another that seems to be doing okay Was hit by the Three damage from Yeah, yeah Yes Let's see Um Yeah, that's an unhappy fire Well, it's fire It's not raging I have Okay Should we put in another roll?

Um Yeah, I can do that Do you need our passive Perception insight and investigation Or is that not super important?

Um It's not super important It's not super important right now Let me see What do I want to do?

I can Okay, so if you If my friend Val Uses their breath weapon again Yes I can save on it, that's half damage right?

Right And so any amount of damage done to the one That is on a thread Assuming that the half damage is like Two or three or above Which I think it should be I think even if they get the half damage The one that's holding on by a thread is probably just going to die anyways And with the other That is a hypothesis So I don't think I need to focus on that one Just because your effects Wait, which one's the one that's nearly dead?

Is it the left or the right?

The left one So I'm going to Look at that right one And The person who succeeds I will poison spray again And that is a 25 to hit That is absolutely a hit That is a Going to hit And that is a Going to be only a four poison damage Okay Four poison damage on the Less damaged one Alright And there's no saving throw there right?

No Alright, so the poison kind of Whirls through and as it passes Through the threads, like the poison works its way Up the threads, just like absorbing And destroying it They seem to be still very upset with you Alright Val So I can Use another breath weapon Which I get Two for long rest Oh for long rest?

Okay Hey Chris, do I get you Correctly?

No He gets two per long rest Oh, it's not Prolong rest I'm just going to take a nap in the middle of the combat I guess you can I could fly four years close What he did say there was They're kind of ethereal and the His sword did not do As much as it could have No, it's because he grazed it Yes, but Okay, here's what I'm thinking Max, you've got your Graze ability on that sword, right?

If you hit the one that's Super damaged, just holding on by a thread When it's your turn After Val, then Even if you miss It's 100% We can focus our efforts on the one with more health left Just so that you can do as much damage as possible How many unarmed strikes do you get?

I don't know I don't know I don't know I think you get one with your action And if you do Flurry of Flows You get more than that But I'm not exactly sure What does Flurry of Flows do?

Two unarmed strikes is a bonus action So That would be three total But you can do them separately So if you want to do your two Two unarmed strikes for your bonus action And then see if that kills it And then if it doesn't, you can use your action Does that make sense?

So what does that do basically?

So you're gonna punch it twice with your bonus action And that's using the Flurry of Flows And then if it doesn't die by then Then you can hit it again with your action As a third punch Give it the old one, two, three One, two, uppercut So that is a plus six Okay On the first one That is a miss With a not one And the second one Is a four Plus six, so it's ten It's also a miss And then we're gonna try for the third The uppercut It seems like it's much harder to hit And it's a sixteen So it is a hit, you finally figured it out So instead of punching through You figure out that if you cut across You're more likely to catch the threads Of essence As you pull through, so how much damage does it do?

One of these six plus four bludgeoning Nice, for each one I only hit one of them, but yeah Right, and it can be three per turn That is not in total damage Do your attacks count as magical?

I don't Maybe not That's what I was saying Sorry, I'm kidding It seems like it does less damage You're sure you just shredded this thing But it seems like it does less damage as the threads just slide off of your arm I mean that is still Not damage before Both of them look in really bad shape Malric Well, did you stick out Prismore?

Oh, sorry Val Prismore Maybe attack the Graze Try and graze, like if Try hit Is there a way I can attack both at once With doing minimal damage Or if you used your breath weapon Or if you used your breath weapon Both of us are tracking Mark Which was completely random Where is Your breath weapon Is here It's in One of these Okay You have Not that breath weapon It is a DC12 Dex 480 pounds Yeah No, that's here That's his Push drag width Max Not your What you currently have Oh, that's how much you can push and drag But what this is Is you roll They must make a DC12 Saving throw By dex Or take 1d10 He will roll a d12 For each of them and they take half As the same as me From his d10 So, what do I do He will roll twice You could just graze the guy who is almost dead I'd like to go through his d12 So, what's the save DC12 Dex DC12, dex Fail And fail So, you take full damage from D10 And this is frost Two Total Yes Okay, two on the first one Okay, the first one Freezes and shatters to the ground Is it dead?

It is dead Yes, roll damage for the second one No, it shattered to the ground and just like kind of sat there still alive Two again It freezes but it is still Alive and now The crystals had water crystals Very upset at you Malric, there's one left It is holding on by a celestial thread I'm going to take my ace of hearts from my playing card deck Give it a kiss And throw the nastiest spiral at it Alright, roll to hit I don't know how much damage it is I have Treat it like a dagger I have surprisingly experienced with this It's going to be 1d4 plus your dexterity modifier Like a throne dagger Well, so to hit, it's my dexterity modifier, right?

Plus your proficiency So, plus six Okay 19 19 is an absolute hit And then I roll 1d4 plus Plus four This is the Seven damage Seven damage Although it doesn't do quite as much as you might think It does slice through The thing shatters into pieces All of this kind of shimmering Coalesces and this net-like rune vanishes And you find you can easily go down the hall Wait, it's dead already Yes, both of them have died I pick up The playing card off the ground And put it back in my deck Nicely done Nice job, friend Malek The ace of clubs on it Is kind of slightly sparkling now It's hearts It is transformed into the ace of clubs It's slightly sparkling and warps and bends Almost as if it hit Now reply Malek Now reply Malek Now if he's playing a game Is there any way maybe he could get Like a plus one on it Wait, it cancels a plus one And daggles when he does it Can he get a plus one If he's Because he's probably going to scan It is displacement, which is all about Deception, sleight of hand and movement So I would say this deck now gives him advantage On any sleight of hand Rolls he uses his deck Also, can it also characterize a plus one Now you're You can convert it into ace of clubs Whenever you want To improve your chances You notice that like the very end Of the hall is kind of Almost like a Vault or something That you can see and there's something that seems To be floating in the air rotating In the middle of it It's more like a lens Although we're talking about a lens Wait, sorry, say that one more time There's like a lens I was listening But my character was not Down at the end of the hall you see What looks like a lens kind of rotating Floating in the air Yeah, the guys at the shop We're talking about the angry The me and the I walk towards the lens I turn around and try to find an exit Okay It's a peculiar oval disc about the Size of a dinner plate Although its exact dimension seems to shift subtly As you look at it, it appears to be crafted from A material that is simultaneously crystal clear And impossibly dark Its edges constantly Ripple and distort as if the very Air around it is being gently pulled and twisted Hold on Yes, I might be able to Figure it out, I'm not sure This is so exciting I'm going to cast detect magic Is that a roll I forget If you cast it as a ritual it is not a roll Okay, well I can cast it as a ritual for free Actually We have like a minute As soon as you start casting detect magic It just like glows Guys, let's put it in your back pocket Wait, sorry Does that interrupt my spell?

No, glows as if it's magic It makes things that are magic glow Forgot about that Can I make an icon check to see if I Have any idea what kind of magic this could be A light bulb as part of the sun Or a room It is very magical, clearly That is going to be a 16 Okay, so you believe that this Lens has something to do with the Focusing of the Displacement essence Gotcha Are there displacer beasts It's focusing some Essence here I can't tell exactly what it's doing But it seems like it has a lot of connection To all these things we've been experiencing With the displacement Hey guys, I'm going to put it in my Bike pocket and see what happens I would highly Advise against that I put it in my back pocket I put it in my back pocket Okay, so while you're talking, Lunara walks over Grabs it and sticks it in her pouch It's Can I Can I talk you with crazy Can I Can I roll persuasion To Okay Is that everything on the right side of the hall That's everything at the end of the hall There's a what There's a what This seems like an open-faced Vault with this lens Twirling You've never seen this part of the Is there any Visions, was there anything In it or was it just dark So You can take it out and Try looking through it Do you want To take it out and look through it I'm going to actually put it up to my Face and see So when you look through it, it gets Even weirder Distances seem to compress and stretch Solid objects appear to shift slightly Out of alignment with themselves As if you're seeing them from multiple perspectives Simultaneously It feels a little bit like the feeling That you've been getting going through the courier tunnels Themselves Wait, can I do something Okay, I'm going to try To walk In one of the shorter Distances And see whether How about you guys watch while I'm doing this To see, do I go Any faster So you walk backwards Like you walk back down the hall No, I walk to the What's the shortest Thing Okay, so you walked in this way You erased the rune by Fighting the mephits, you turned right There was like the net rune And you Not like you know them You went down You went down Into the vault and so you turn around and you come Back the other way, as you start entering the hall You start accelerating fast You feel like even as fast as you were going before Maybe you're going like twice as fast now And so you're watching As Lunara's like And it's like In Star Wars where they go into warp speed And suddenly it's like Is it like where you draw the runes on the thing And then all of a sudden this leg goes zoom in value Well as Lunara started to go into the next hallway The runes glowed brightly Seemed to focus through the lens And then she just like \*swoosh\* Guys, come in So it's focusing runes It's focusing displacement energy You're able to follow You still are accelerated just not quite as fast How about we have everyone Hold my hand and just go through Okay This is a bad idea I would like to object And watch the other side Yeah, I'd be We're still going faster than normal, just not quite as fast as you You can slow down a bit No, I'm holding all your hands so that we all just I would like to let Let me decline your See, I objected like three times already I want to go to the Can I Getting back to like Half an hour ago when I wanted to go to The library, are we still doing that You were trying to go to the Library Okay, can you guys pause a second You suggested we go to the Chimborro carcass You were on your way there through The tunnels, but then you got stuck In the tunnels because of this effect that The runes was having on the whole party The tunnels is the only way to get there Well, you could have gone down the hill, but it would have taken you A very long time Here there is Cookie remains There is Hey, hey guys, come on, come on There's checkmix So Max, your group was On the way to the Chimborro Archive, they were simply not able to get there Because they got stuck in the tunnels Hey guys Check this out Zoom If you guys want anything I can do Are you circling?

Don't want to go Using down the tunnels, you follow them No, I want to grab on to The zoomie thing So you manage to Catch up to Lunara as soon as you catch up No, I stop and wait for her As soon as you hold her hand you are also Going faster Okay That should maximize anyone?

We don't know any side effects I've learned A scientific method I'm going to Wait for Any possible side effects to appear before I Wait for them to grow up I I'm going to keep traveling until I find Okay So when Val catches up The remainder of the tunnels seem to work fine And you're able to very quickly Get yourself to the Entrance in the woods where you Come out through the tunnels Into the lush forest Near the Chimborro, yes, all of you are together Yes Do I go faster Even on ground?

Only where the Runes are glowing I take them Into the Chimborro Wait, hold on a second I was going to put a I was going to ask Val to put To put speed Ruins on my boots So that we can go Zoom Zoom What could possibly go wrong?

This is an infinite motion machine There's nothing dangerous happening with this The speed ruin makes the thing go faster And the thing pulls the speed ruin And the fact that one of these creatures Appeared the first time you screwed up and two appeared The second and prop you should try again I'm sure I would like to ask you to put stuff on my boots Except we're next to the Guys who just put stuff in my Boots place How far are we from the Timber We're right there We're here So why do we need to go faster?

Because Why not How about we go faster when we need to go faster?

Can we compromise on that?

Can we put speed ruins on the boots the next time we need to go fast?

Next time we need to go we'll put the speed ruins on Next time we need to go fast we can put speed ruins on the boots But let's avoid any possible accidents I would like to bring them Into my little Library shack So it's just a shack in the woods It looks like a normal shack and then you have to Open the trap door And then we all start climbing down the ladder Into the library and then we get into the library And everyone's excited Yippee Yippee I'm so excited Can I ask Yes what's your question Are there any side effects Of the We don't know yet we haven't used them long enough Can I just wait What do you think are the side effects currently?

Side effects to you Having moved so quickly You are feeling a little bit jittery Like you drank way too much coffee But that could have been the triple shot espresso That you had up in the cafe It's hard to tell the difference Alright so let's Hold on I would like to know that You are feeling a little bit Jittery as well Hold on a second One second, Bryce Can you pause a second So Prismore leads you into The Into the Timber Oak archive Above room and then Leads you down a ladder When you get to the bottom of the ladder Prismore you are met By Rowan Oakenshade Who you know to be the caretaker And druid sage at the Timber Oak Archive And And He turns to you Ah Prismore So lovely of you to meet us and Who are these Friends you've brought into our Secret Library I would like to roll a situation to persuade them That they're not complete crazy Because I know that Bryce Is probably going to do something Like put speed on his feet For preparation for later I'd like to roll a situation You can roll persuasion I know my library plays And then introductions you are Okay that's a 9 plus Persuasion would be Where is persuasion Plus 3 Plus 3 I'm proficient so does that do anything That's what gives you the plus Yeah it's plus 3 Okay plus 3 so That's 12 Have Put speed on my Boots I heard that you did an excellent job With the yule tree raising In the courtyard Yes I know Wait I'm going to pull up my Object of weirdness No no you're not And see do you happen to Know what I'd like to persuade Bryce Not to pull up his object of weirdness That looks like an essence lens Designed to focus the Essences it Looks different than ours Okay notice Put speed back Not on each other You're saying we have a lens of our own In the grotto Below but the grotto seems amiss Like the vines They shudder as if in pain Something is not right We have reason to believe that The magic in the festival Around the citadel Has been arrived How punctual The orchard breathes with us If you listen You can hear its heartbeat So can I Just add a little risk that we can Put two fingers on And see if it's doing alright What does Pocky know about He seems a little woo Have you seen a couple of drow Accompanied by a member Of the royal family It was just a noble In a military outfit We got no clue who the member was There were some drow Poking about but normally We don't allow anyone in the library Who is not a member Oh I guess Their persuasion works very well Except under very unusual Circumstances We were wondering if You had Knew anything Lunara you did such a good job With the Yule tree Perhaps you could look at our orchard Yes I do Or the grotto I'm gonna go over and get it Is this like a psychology experiment How many times we throw your dice up And then we're gonna throw it again And then we're gonna throw it again Will it be like 40 times And eventually use it No these is defaults right We'll use that Test the music Test the music Rowan brings you Down Rowan is the Druid Did we talk about Rowan Sure What do you want to know about him I forgot about him I didn't know if we talked about him on the I have like This group of friends we talked about I didn't know if that was at all related Rowan is kind of like the Is anyone hurt Beside me No No You're like scratched Like the tiniest scratch Rice might be But They're feeling a little jittery He's feeling a little hungover He's mentally disabled IRL But other than that I don't think I have anything to fix that Alright let's Let's get a move on I need to be home before Too long Is there anything else I'm gonna stay at the festival And let him go do the thing in the orange They said something about the grotto Is that his?

Does he know where that is The grotto is down below in an area of the library you've never been in But Rowan is Offering I didn't know if it was an all-safes mail about the library or If it's just like Roll History He mentioned a grotto Let me see if I know anything about it Roll history you said or history Rice what are you rolling History is it Dirty 20 You had seen Reference to this place You know that The history books of Everpeak Citadel grow in this Library from seeds into Living books What I think If it is alright with you Library master 23 for nature I'm gonna pick out the orchard Grotto sorry Orchard Or a grotto Oh so he's going down the grotto Same place I misspoke Same place Let's go check it out Could I accompany him down to the grotto To observe Where the books are grown and make sure that they're All in order we have reason to believe that there might be Something wrong with the lens down there I Have the utmost reference for libraries I work in the wine Absolutely you are welcome to come through Perhaps there is something you could do to Realign the harmonies Of the verdant grove But of course come 23 what do I notice Wait what 23 what you notice is that The natural essence flowing Through seems to be blocked in a Similar way that it was blocked up By the yule tree Mallard gets a Chaotic idea Of possibly switching the lens to the one That Bryce has Ah But we don't do that No we're not gonna do that So Bryce has the lens Can we put chance For the lens to be Kept with an individual who might Actually know what he's doing No no no Bryce is It's fine if Bryce Has it As long as he is responsible with it Yes can you please put speed Bounds on it Honestly it's not a bad idea I only got a 12 on Persuasion this is not gonna Go over well Rowan do you think it would be wise to maybe switch out The lens that seems malfunctional Well this lens is for specifically Sharing a displacement The lens is part of our Grotto and the nature Essence flows through it into the library But the essences don't seem to be Flowing as well as they usually do In the grotto Hmm let's see I have a question Um did the drought book Who came through here did they go down to the grotto They were asking About lenses But I said nothing to them because I did not trust them Wise I compliment him They seem to not Be very trustworthy May I also Um try and Figure out if the If the problem with the Blocked flow of essences Is from something With the lens or if it is a problem With the essences We found it It seems to be of the essences Have you noticed any The essences themselves Are the ones that are out of whack Now it scans the rooms For any anomalies That may be Placed around the room Um so give me a History check History is wisdom Intelligence Uh okay That's three Eight Um you Don't see any chalked rooms around anywhere Is there any normal rooms That like work out of place Like that wouldn't be You've only seen the chalked rooms in the couriers tunnels As they Relate to displacement Is there any other What are my options for things I could do right now That would benefit us Uh what are What are any options Like what things can I do right now that would benefit us Can I just like Skip a turn and heal my scratch Um unless You have magical healing you won't heal it until you've slept for the night 'Tis but the scratch I'll heal it when I get home Yeah I can heal him So what can I do Um right now So right now your players are Talking with Rowan And he's told you about the Grotto and the verdant Lens Yes You might ask him questions about What he knows You might offer to go help Do you know where the essences that flow through this Uh that flow through this Lens come from Or like where they would come from We believe that there's something wrong with these essences Ah Roll a Persuasion Persuasion Okay Unless you were trying a different angle Like are you trying to speak to him like sage to sage Or are you Like Yes I'm trying to ask for like sagely advice Okay but you're also trying to get him to trust you enough to Tell you what he knows right Yes I think but my I don't think my Character sees it that way You can try to get a DC tenor better on Persuasion and then you can help I don't think my character has a um I think my character is fully convinced that He trusts me So maybe even if he doesn't Okay can you roll persuasion Can I try history just to check Cause I haven't rolled history yet To see what I know about it Uh what is the Difference what do you use Religion Just where do you have to History plus four just roll a plus four History Religion relates to the divine gods So I'll just roll History or the undivine gods So 15 If you get the I'll roll the ability Uh huh That's a good question You know that the festival tonight Is celebrating What's called the dawn's crown Which is a convergence of Celestial bodies and you know all about this Very involved You think that that Has something to do with renewing The energy that powers This citadel And something about the Essences Can you roll history or arcana I would love to roll arcana What is I don't even have arcana That is 23 So you believe that the Dawn's crown is related to Renewing the energy and the essences And you have been working tirelessly in the observatory To kind of reconstruct some of the Dusty old broken lenses And you found a small orrery Which is like a model of the night skies That has tiny lenses in it Yes, okay And you've been trying to figure it out It has tiny lenses In the model of the night sky An orrery is like A mechanical device That represents Like the celestial bodies And how they move around And then in it there's these little lenses Like in the place where planets would be?

It's kind of a weird Clockwork mechanism And like are there not Representations of the celestial bodies Representations of the Stars mostly Okay, but then there are also lenses Now, give me one more roll 23 You remember that One of the different lenses look different In this small orrery And one of them looks a little bit like The lens that you found in the corridor Although the lens in the corridor is like This big And the ones in the orrery are like that big Oh yeah, and I'm just Going to guess this, but does it fit in my Pouch?

Can it expand and contract?

You're able to fit it in your Pouch, but it's more like a backpack So it kind of slides down the back of the backpack Yes, so It's only dinner plates It's like dinner plate size, yeah So So wait, so Does the one that looks Diffused by this Troubled Does the The lens that looks different, is that The same one as the displacement lens or is it The one in the displacement lens in my orrery?

You'd have to kind of go back and take a look At it, but it does seem like The lenses had an unusual Each one had an unusual look and color To them One of them looked different specifically?

The different lenses in the orrery Had different appearances and one of them Seems like it looked very familiar To the lens you found in the So, I I read the books reduced by the Okay You see the page flipped open And it says The drow thief, Cheeky, snuck away To look at the book and read What was upon it So it's like Summary of what I was just written He seemed confused to be reading About exactly what he was thinking I set the book down He sets the book down Okay, so The words kind of appear As you're No, stop I will travel back to my The observatory and the library And I will try and figure out what I can About the About these lenses, because I think I have a device in there that might be helpful If we could figure out What's going on, there might be A specific lens that we need to That we need to fix or repair At some point.

Back to the tunnels No Are you able To help our grotto?

I don't think we can Help it directly right now Unless there's anything else Unless there's any specific things you've noticed Ludenara, would you be willing to try the Same ritual that you did with the yule tree?

Okay That's a bad idea Um So actually a 22 Okay, so Rowan leads you down to the grotto It's a lush grotto And the vines of the grotto kind of come up together To grasp onto A different Lens Um \[typing\] So you Place your hands on the roots Of the grotto and dip one Of your hand on the roots and one of your hand into the water And you begin to chant the same Ritual of verdant Essence And you seem to be able to kind of like pull against a Blockage and cause More of the nature's essence To flow up through and into the grotto Wait, can I also at the same time Try to identify Blockage?

Yeah That's a good idea Another one One I said one No, that's a seven That's a one This is a one That's the same It's next to it Is there a modifier?

Seven plus Um This is Prismar Seven actually So um 14 You have a plus seven?

Yes Wait to what?

Ten eight here?

Oh, cause he's wisdom Yes, I'm a druid I have a Seven key on the stokes Okay, so Lunara, you feel like The natural flow Of the essence is to come Up and towards the grotto But it seems like someone has Misdirected it Or something Okay Has misdirected it Down Towards some area underneath The citadel I'm gonna do another trick To try to figure out where This area is It's down under The citadel?

It seems Somewhere down under the citadel Um, I'm going to say Um, 19 Um, this that told me Wait, what did you roll?

Kind of where Um, 12 plus seven For what?

Um, trying to figure out Where, like what skill did you roll?

Nature.

Oh, gotcha Yes, I'm rolling it All you can tell is that The flow that had once been directed Down and should have been up, you're able to Pull and kind of pull On the blockage enough that it comes unclogged And the verdant energy flows up And you can see it flowing into the The lens The verdant nature's lens Oh, AI circles.

So that's no longer plagued AI circles.

It seems to Shine through and glow Great, um, noted Let's go and try to Um, Pre-wunched Out of curiosity Did you plan Into the adventure that we would end up Here?

Did I plan into the adventure?

A GM never reveals his secrets, master How many chat GPT images Do you make?

A bunch No, no, these are Literally, I'm hearing you type Them in as you speak I have tons of different images that I make Wait, so Should we take this other one as well?

Should we start Collecting them?

So you notice as the lens Comes towards you, it seems like it's kind of Like Pushing against the lens in your bag Like as it comes closer, the lens in your bag seems Like it wants to get a little further away Jordan, do you want to take the Lens?

I'll take the displacer Okay, we should have Okay, and trusty Stealthy person takes the lens That sounds so cute He doesn't body the displacement energy very well Oh yeah, you should get Bonuses on stealth So as you take the displacement lens Your pack of cards shuffles itself Into your pocket So yes, stealth And you Rowan looks at you and says, it appears That the lens has chosen you for some Reason Free lens Free lens Look, you now have Two lenses so you can connect them and make Glasses I object to this I object to this marriage The lens from my library, I want you to put It back It wants to come to me Is that like a thing we can do?

Can we ask for A couple of them?

Alright, how are You all feeling?

Do you want to take a Break?

Is this a good place to stop For the night?

Do you want to keep going?

I think we should Take a bit of a break I think we should come back soon, but I don't think I'm going to last much longer

Like an elementary cheating tool, so they're like did you use chat tbt for your research?

I'm like it helped a little bit It's either you chat you cheated right just get you get everything or you did all the work by yourself I used it for a sixth grade assignment last year, but I just lucked stuff up with it It is both powerful enough to help you learn and powerful enough to help you not learn Alright When last we left our intrepid adventures, why do you always use intrepid?

It's the same word my dad uses That's cuz that's from when I played D\&D with your dad I figured but it's like really Hey chat, hey guys, welcome back all right You had secured the verdant lens from the timber oak archive and Pocky Winters had the idea/request to head back up to the Observatory that he had been working on And when you got there When you got there you realize that there was a riddle engraved into the orrery Miniature orrery And it was a puzzle so in between our games I Provided the puzzle to Jasper and Jordan I will read you the riddle Okay, four figures grace the skies known through ages in the scholars eyes name them shape them heed their call From each a letter you must enthrall The serpent coils in northern gleam its truth begins where all first seem the archer proud doth knock his bow Count five letters in and let it show the stallion winged in Eastern flight Its second bow will be your guiding light the maiden pure no blame shall hold her center letter shall be foretold Bind these letters into a word so bright to key to guide you through the night But after pulling them from the four constellations which were serpens the first letters s Oh, yeah serpens Serpens which is the T Pegasus Pegasus which is the second value for the a and then Virgo All right, so give me a knowledge Arcana Actually, hold on One moment you have some options on the skill that you would like to use Well, I would love to use our car All right Yes 25 so you quickly realize that in the miniature orry if you kind of adjust the lenses just right the light that's been coming in through the through the window strikes the lenses and beams it against this unusual kind of starry mural on the back wall and with a thunk and a whir and swirling blue lights the window opens up to reveal To reveal a celestial lens Kind of floating in the midst I'm gonna yank it Maybe I hate to be too self-centered, but I That's student for myself.

All right, so Same size lens.

Okay.

So we're just going around collecting lenses.

Yes You'll get something How many are Yes You see five different lenses on the orry are they kind of like Is there one that looks like the verbiage that looks like the displacement Kind of whitish the celestial lenses blue Like dark blue Speedy boots I see we just got by a teleporter make this so much easier.

Oh, yeah, just off the off the teleport merchants Yeah, you know that guy eBay so a bit bigger than that maybe not quite the hand size Yeah, and they were everyone sells their magic items , okay, can you remind me why it's called a man?

So you are in the Observatory there's this lens kind of floating in the air behind the store.

That's just opened Okay, if you want to try to remove it, it seems a little bit wedged and you feel like you need to focus some kind of skill or intention So think about Think about more knowledge related so it could be arcana It could be religion.

It could be insight.

It could be perception.

I see could be performance You're able to pull it down and you feel like thoughts and insights flow more freely into you while you're holding this you've noticed this in the Library before like you get better work done when you're in the library But it seems that somehow Are you gonna try to push them towards each other Can you roll a perception check All right You notice a very faint relief on the back of the mural which shows a Very large or e and you can tell because of the size of the figures beneath it with kind of a hole up high with light streaming down through the or e and into There's it's kind of like a bigger more complicated version of the little one Which has five and it looks like the larger lenses that you have are about the right size So there's many many different lenses all throughout it.

There's many different lenses Yes, but they have they there of it's hard to tell because it's like a little etched in but you got a natural 20 so you can tell that they They look like the five that are on the small or e and they Yes, so it's not it's a mural of a large or So we only have Yay coffee fairy my favorite French presses I didn't pressed magic.

Oh my gosh Have the fun, thank you I'll be this we can Alright All right, okay, so there was what thing was pointing to the Oh That was something that Lunara Lunara detected Yeah Can I try to scale the wall and place my?

Lens in one of the murals from the ceiling or is it a new ceiling or on the wall?

It's it's like a wall of the observatory That had this that had opened up and there was the lens floating and then behind the lens There's more imagery on the back.

There's more imagery on the back.

Yeah behind the lens, which we already retrieve.

Yes Okay, and it is and the imagery on the back was of a five lens mural A large kind of steampunk ish.

We've never seen before No, you've seen the little one on his desk and you had previously thought by the way you were you had thought That there was something about this Don's crown convergence that happens every hundred years It's gonna happen this festival that you've been studying that had to do this little or are you on your desk that you've been?

Trying to figure out how to use What does the castle the dungeon does the castle have a dungeon there's lots of passages all throughout the castle and under the castle and No one's really explored them.

So Val you give me a role history me No, he meant like a place to keep prisoners.

Oh, is there a prison?

Yes Like a dungeon, okay, can you be role history?

You know, there's lots of ruins that mean don't go here and You see those quite frequently throughout the courier tunnels What can you do right now?

You can talk with the other players and decide what you want to do next I love it.

You're right.

Well, so we just Can I uh Remember off pure memory where the source is Where the um Divergence is like where the energy's going the energy was going somewhere underneath the castle.

Yes Yes, it's like starboard without the sugar.

Exactly right without the light Yes, but if I were to go into the courier tunnels You believe it was hundreds of feet below the castle And well the courier tunnels are a little disorienting it's hard to exactly know where you are because you're kind of zooming around and kind of Yes, semi teleporting Where's the Courier tunnels is oh Yeah Sure Total 21 21 you do know that there are some of the tunnels that exit out into the main Road that leads up the side of the mountain where the tunnels go quite far down That would be you know, is there any other places we haven't explored yet?

Like I've gone to the library Let's see the ford Song hall there's some stuff going on with drow Though we can't yeah Well, there are the the drought emissaries that you've seen and you've also seen some other drow around some of them look a little hippie ish Is it possible to investigate that yeah, absolutely track them down Should I try to follow the tracks using my you can use your Investigation you've seen some you've seen some drows that kind of look like this It's not usually the look that drow like to Should I roll for an investigation?

Yeah Yeah Total 20, okay So you are able in the marketplace to you kind of mingle in the marketplace in the festival and You see one of these like hippie or drow Shopping for some crystals in the crystal booth Yes Yes It is it is good to see another of my fellows.

Are you here to to free the essences?

Me mother From there this this place is a prison a wrongful Wrong you must know that these essences long to be free and they've been trapped here for hundreds of years for centuries How many essences are there?

No one knows Where are you from?

I?

am from names northern drow colony Why those of us who believe have come here to help?

When did you arrive here three days ago?

Who told you to come or did you or did you just feel the essence is calling out to you I Don't know that I can tell you unless you you join us to help us I would be I would be happy to join you and frame the essences You must speak with Lord Alrick then Where shall I find him?

He is in the drow MS the the drow emissary the the Embassy the embassy yes, do you know the noble that is accompanying him Lord Alrick?

Yes, oh yes, he is Terrifying but one must make certain Compromises if one is to free the essences how Would you go about freeing the essences there is a plan, but I cannot tell you you must ask Lord Alrick Okay Don't worry Would you Like to play a game What kind of game game well I have this deck of playing If you can Guess the exact suit of my playing card.

I will give you five gold five gold But if you get it wrong you have to give me one goal.

I don't have a goal.

That is far too much money Roll persuasion Unless Lunara wants to use their want I Love it Hmm now he's getting a little bit suspicious of you a lot suspicious actually well here hold on a lot suspicious He he suddenly realizes maybe he's talking to the wrong guy and he like dashes back Let's go let's continue I'm not good.

He is a sorry your palans.

You're usually All right, let's head let's head to the you see the the hapline sorrel comes up.

That's a funny fellow isn't he?

sure is We've seen a lot of you seen a lot of them around here lately.

Oh Not since times before How many are the How many of you seen so far around Around here these parts there seem to be a dozen of them or so Counting their nobles.

Oh, I don't know I just see them run in and out Let us head to the chapel where the it's chapel Place where the drow ah oh the embassy Are we headed to the embassy or collective?

Where is Lord Alrick?

Where Lord Alrick is halfling He's the halfling.

I don't know this Lord.

What's that?

Embassy or we can get the other room The other Where we tell the Oh Mary bells, yeah, okay, you can go there you can go to the What would you like to do at the cafe Is it quicker to go to the embassy or take the underground room The embassy so you know that if you have a message sure go ahead Yeah You know that if there is So, you know that the drought embassy has been at the Citadel for for decades but it is it's kind of like a spooky place There's not often a lot of people there.

There's dealings People say between the drow and the embassy and the nobles of ever peak Citadel I Could go alone and act as one of the drows Sure you'd have to get some Yeah, I mean they're like heavy velvet robes By a giant set of heavy velvet robes you might be able to steal What I I will buy these clothes with double the what I are there any other Drow that I didn't just scare off in the area you've seen so you've seen these hippiest drow you've seen kind of the Menacing looking drow, which is kind of the usual So the menacing looking drow what were they wearing those are like the deep cloaks Can we find one?

Is there a way we can find one?

That's how we're going to the embassy Yes, so the embassy I'd like to find one too, the skies are so when we go into them So you're suggesting we kill one of the drow and take his clothes We should take the two shortest people and put them in the coat Like the two people in the trench coat so we can fit more people or just everyone goes in the trench coat Why does, why, we just need one person He needs to go as the face but other than that like what are what is the rest of us gonna do?

That's very suspicious It's this unusually tall drow with another person where who has horrible eye foot coordination It's just walking along It would be amazing Amazingly fast way to get caught Alright, so what would you all like to do?

Would you like to go to the embassy?

Or should we go somewhere else first?

Is it faster by tunnel?

You know that if you need to deliver a letter to the embassy You're not allowed to use the tunnels to go into the embassy You have to like go to the front room of the embassy and deliver the letter Is it one of those passages with danger danger do not enter?

You don't know You just know that you go into the front room And you try to stay as little time as you can Because it's kind of intense Can I see?

Yes Do you have any other images for us to see?

Do I have any other what?

Drow images for you to see?

That's the entrance right?

You guys want to head to the embassy or go to the library?

I think we are already in the library Yes I've got a picture of Barth Yeah we're in the library Barth That's an intense Barth is going to take us out Wait maybe I'll go back to Barth And ask him if he knows anything of the drow in the area Alright so Barth, Barth, Barth I would love to go to the embassy I think that's our next step Let's figure out what's going on here So Barth first Then embassy You wanted to get a snack at the coffee shop Alright How about we go snack, Barth, embassy Alright What did you want to do at the embassy?

Welcome back Did you want another espresso?

No, no thank you Are you sure?

I could pour you one with a little bit of lavender syrup and a hint of cardamom I'm sure that will never grow back Oh that's right it is a bit wilted isn't it?

Can I ask?

It's called espresso?

Why is that?

Because it makes you go fast And what part of the word?

Express Oh I see Prismore It's called espresso Can you brew stuff for me?

Like special drinks?

What kind of special drinks?

How old are you?

22 I might need to see your ID Show us the ID Yes I can brew a special drink for you What?

Our guard's not supposed to drink My friend is a little scratched up over here Do you have a drink that could fix up a couple scratches?

Do you think we need a drink?

Oh yes I do Could I get like a three hit point drink?

One, one, one She takes some herbs and kind of mixes them up And I'd be willing to pay some gold for that Sprinkles a little bit Once and silver at least Boils it and you see like a poof of like verdant energy It starts to go up and then goes like She's like It may not be as strong as it usually is but this should help So how many hit points can you drink?

I don't know I don't know How many hit points can you drink?

I don't know Why don't you try drinking it?

Why don't you try drinking it?

Espresso Espresso Espresso Okay It won't last very long, it's a fresh drink Espresso I'll just drink it to heal the cut Alright, it fills you back up to full hit points Can you make one more that I can use for later?

They don't last very long They're just fresh, it's like a fresh smoothie Can I buy a mini refrigerator?

Is there any other potions that you can give me that last a little longer that I can use later?

So what did it do?

It healed me one heart Okay So now my scratch, my elbow bump is gone So now my scratch, my elbow bump is gone Yeah, you're back to 28 if my pencil works Alright Now instead of being at 27 Instead of being at like what?

97% health Now you're back at 100 Now my elbow bump is gone Wait, how much damage does the explosion of the rod do?

I don't know I don't think you know that It would explode Okay, so I head over to Vart When you walk into the Don Forge So the Don Forge is So the Don Forge is An intense Giant Forge There's like a lava source that comes in There's a bunch of different lifts And mechanical structures in there There's like a Automatic hammer But it seems like there's smoke coming out of it And you see Barth kind of swearing at it Ugh Ugh, damn it He's like trying to work at something Oh Oh there, could you come and Could you come and give me a hand with this?

Of course You look strong Okay So you see that he's working on this It's almost like a clockwork system He has a big panel off And there's a clockwork system that's not Working particularly well And it's kind of grinding on the gears So how would you all like to help?

Um Is there a way I can like immediately fix it?

Um You could roll an investigation check You could Use If you have Tinker's tools Or Kana Perception Could help Yeah Sure I have \+5 in the investigation I have \+4 in the Perception Well you have a 19 so you get a 23 I get a 23 Um, you notice that there's some gears that have Seem to have fallen off And rolled underneath some areas And so you're able to Kind of run around and as you're reaching under you notice that There's maybe even some more gears under there That look very old So you start pulling out all of these gears And he's like, oh, those could be very Helpful, there are parts of this that I Never quite figured out Alright, and you're rolling investigation Uh, 17 Hey What is your, is that With?

Yeah, it's with It's 12 \+ 5 You start looking through some of the gears that Prismore has found And you believe that The new ones go in spots that seem Um The ones that Look like they're new, they've been used Going to some pretty obvious spots, but you also Think some of the ancient gears might go in some additional Spots as well Does someone want to try Reassembling it?

Uh, Would that be?

Really strange Or sleight of hand?

I don't think sleight of hand would help reassemble Giant gears Probably Were they giant?

Well, you're pretty big, right?

You can push and pull up to what, like 300 and something pounds?

He was 480 push pull Yeah, 480 For mechanistic, you can use Athletics for physical precision Sleight of hand for precise Manipulation Arcana for knowledge of magical Systems History, investigation Can you do arcana?

No, I don't think so I can try sleight of hand He has sleight of hand \+8 What's the strongest?

Nat 1 Um, there is A whir of Mechanistic gear-like Essence, and it seems to Pulse and pulse, and then You hear this, like, sound Like gears grinding on Each other, and Out pop 3 Muppets Muppets, 3 Muppets Adorable mechanical Creatures Aww That want to kill us?

Can I give him a hug?

Uh, you can try, but first You need to roll initiative So yeah, they want to kill us For initiative, who can hug First?

Uh, Pocky's got a 4 on initiative Okay Val 19 Maurek 8 I've wanted to Oh, don't grab, don't grab, don't grab 16 What did you get?

Uh, 19 Uh, there's more up here 16 What's your initiative, to try?

What did you get?

9 plus 1, so Lunara 10 What did Lunara get?

10, what did Maurek get?

Uh, Maurek got an 80, I think Pocky?

4 4, 8, 10, what did the baddies get?

15 Just behind me Yeah, there's more about a 16 So you said 10 Yes, Lunara got a 10 So, a tiny mechanical creature is assembled from interlocking brass gears and metal plates Steam hisses from their joints and they move with steady clockwork efficiency Uh, Barth swears and stumbles back away from them It is Val's turn Do they look like, are they moving towards us to attack us?

Yes, absolutely Yes, absolutely They seem somewhat enraged Intent on killing us?

Yes Sad How about we punch in damage and be non-lethal here So that we can recur these So what's our plan?

Yes, I give them hugs They're trying to kill us, Bryce But what you do is non-lethal damage So you want to do persuasion No, I want to do non-lethal damage So get them down What's the point?

Non-lethal damage means you're doing damage while not killing them Yeah It has to be with a melee hit But what's the point?

To adopt them Because they're trying to kill us Val, Val So I can Is it, is this still the same day?

There's three of them How many are there?

Three I used only one of my breath weapons so far Out of two Can we see the third one?

I don't know How many of them are flying?

What's that?

Your dad, he very much like creating new cons because he wants to do the fire right there I was going to be really awesome if we pulled in front of these garage doors So we're like facing out for tomorrow from one side Is there someone that can move it?

I mean Not legally but I can do it If that's what you want, you have to know the keys That's a great question Is it in the car still?

It might still do in the car The car's unlocked for sure I could do it if I wasn't playing the game I could do it if I wasn't playing the game I could do it if I wasn't playing the game I will do it if you will cover my costs by incurring Alright Alright They are flying but they're kind of clumsy flyers Two of them are flying, one of them's on the ground They all seem like they have clockwork wings So I could breath weapon or I could try and break my hands on the metal with unarmed strikes Yes, those are two great options What did you breath weapon?

A fire Fire seems like it might be I disagree I don't think sharp weapons are going to be good against them Yeah, bludgeoning might be good actually because piercing and slashing is probably not going to be very good but if you dent the metal it's probably going to be pretty effective So would you try and roll three?

They look complicated Like pocket watches inside out How many freaking points do I have?

It seems like they're made almost a pure essence Oh, we can't adopt them How many focus points do I have?

How many focus points?

You get a fair amount I believe I think it's your level plus your modifier What would your modifier do?

Like your attack modifier I mean, what does it say?

You have three and regain all expended after you finish your full or long rest How far are these speakers away from us?

They're pretty close, they kind of popped right out so within 10 or 20 feet of you the cafe that we can have a short rest Sure See, it was a perfect idea to get a snack I don't think we all regained too much from it Hey, you got a rat Wait, a short rest?

That's not straw sloth, is it?

Max, you get an inspiration point for coming up with the idea to stop for a snack and Jordan you get an inspiration point for realizing that it was a short rest It means that you have one advantage roll that you can use At any point you can say, I want to take advantage on this roll Where do I put this in?

There's inspirations So if you have inspiration, you put a little X there or a fillet in Alright, Val, the clock is ticking I back up to three And so are the enemies Wow It's Yeah, clockwork I will do a flurry of blows for one of the focus parts Alright On the one on the ground Good Prestidigitation, that's the one that does all the minor magic basically It's like, you can make little effects or magic Alright First one of two 14 plus 6 That is a hit That's a D6 plus 4 of bludgeonies So 8 points Does your flurry of blows count as magic?

I don't think so It's just two more As you hit it, there's a grinding of gears and a kind of Yeah, it's just two unarmed strikes, like two normal ones There's this kind of an explosion sound from it right where you hit it And you must make a dexterity save Okay That's nice My dex save is 6 10 Total Correct Okay, you take 4 thunder damage and you're thrown back 10 feet Maybe another stop at the coffee shop after 4 you said?

Yes, 4 points of damage And you're thrown back 10 feet But you hit it, right?

He did I have a second You can run back in and do it again The real question is, is it bloody?

You surely call it, is it bloody?

Alright, you go back in And for my second flurry of blows is a nat 20 That's gonna be 2d6 Is there a confirm anything?

Nope, you just hit You get twice the number of die rolls plus one time the number of modifiers Okay, so 6 plus 6 plus what?

That is your max roll, that is 16 That is the most possible damage you can do Alright, I'm gonna say on a nat 20 you figured out how to kind of like punch it right between the gear plates And you're able to do full damage to it And it just disintegrates into parts You exactly kill it And I have a standard action left because that was the bonus action from flurry of blows It's the bonus Right, okay It gives you two punches So I have another punch that I could do as a standard Well, you have an action that you can use for a punch or not for a punch You are welcome to go and punch one or the other one So I can like jump into the air and punch one Okay, let's do that Flying back kick And then the right I don't know Maybe, well if I had to guess what it gives you two iron arm strikes Otherwise it would just be one But Yeah, that's not gonna hit with the 9 But it was close enough that you touched it and when you touched it it did make that grinding explosion sound again So now you get to roll another dexterity 6, yay 24 You knew it was coming And so you quickly jump away and you might have been too tentative in your attack which is why you missed But you didn't take the damage and you weren't thrown backwards Alright, prince more Ooh What can I do?

You can slash it I don't know if that would be very effective You can also, um, can I breathe on it?

Absolutely You got a little frost as well Frost might be good for freezing Uh, not, that's a cantrip Yeah, that's different Yeah, that's your cantrip I'm like a cold dragon You also have, okay so I think your breath weapon is 1d8 1d10 right?

His breath weapon is 1d10 He has right of frost 1d8 and he has poison spray as 1d12 I think being a construct this thing will probably be immune to poison I mean the question is, is it poison or acid?

The question is, is it bloody?

How do I tell where my breath weapon is?

Is it bloody yet?

Uh, there's, there's stones, just stones Um Yeah, both poison spray and rain of frost So theoretically I could use I could use magic missile on one of the fine ones Could I use thunderous fight?

Uh, well that's one that you could use when you smack it You very much could, um, I think you could, I think if you want to go for something that you can do forever, like something that doesn't take up resources, you could do your ray of frost I think that seems like a good idea Well, I mean the other thing is these seem like thunder aligned elementals Yes, they might be resistant to thunder They'd be resistant to thunder but they'd be more, um much more colored, they might resistant to cold unresistant to, um like acid/poison Uh, but they're also automatons So I think acid could work because it's acid, but poison probably not.

So I'd say well your D8, uh, that's unarmed so when you, that's when you punch it You're not as good at punching as I am Ray of frost Plus 6 when you, that sounds good Um, the only, yes, and ray of frost would get both of them, correct?

Uh, ray of frost is a single target It's a It's a ray, hello Yeah, no, I'm Alright, Prince Mor Ray of frost Ray of frost Is it a uh, to hit?

Saving throw?

Alright, so roll to hit Uh, I D20 18 Plus 6 The freezing burst smacks it smack in the middle of it Now you're gonna roll damage?

No Roll 1 D8 Yeah, no that's Well wait, are you attacking the same one that he kicked at, or are you attacking the other one?

Um, that one died?

No The first one died.

One of them that I killed Okay, well the second one you kicked at you missed I'm gonna, I'm gonna scope the completely unharmed one Maybe they only get Alright 7 points of damage?

You freeze it and you see gears frozen kind of falling to the ground and it seems to be like But it doesn't explode.

It does not explode Alright, now the baddies go Bum, ba-da-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum And it does get reduced movement I don't know if, I probably still reach all of us, but Alright The first creature the kind of beetle wings on the back prop open and it hurls a whirring clockwork orb to a point directly between you three that starts like \*imitates clockwork\* \*imitates clockwork\* And then Uh, um The second one Can I Can I push Prismarine for me so he takes the No, you're not He has the highest AC and the most attack The second one zooms towards you But it's frozen With spinning saw-like appendages But it's frozen It's not frozen Uh, it gets a 12 Against you Against your AC of 17 So it flies down and attacks, the other one flies in to attack you as well And gets a 22 Wait, no, one of them is dead There are three Yes, so there's two left One of them threw a bomb and attacked Yeah, oh Or sorry, threw an orb that is starting to That is starting to let go So they swooped in, one of them hit you, the one that hit you did six points of damage, slashing Okay, yep With its serrated blades Six points?

Sara, you are up Wait, no, I'm not at 18 Wait, no, no I'm at 14 Okay What did you take down?

The explosion The explosion Hey, hey, hey, Jordan Do you have mending?

I do actually, I use it to fix books All the time in the library I try to build up my character for Laura I have no idea Okay What if you mend it So that it mends The dead one so that we get A companion Well, I don't know if I'd be able to Mend something that exploded But I certainly could do something creative Could you try to make it look helpful?

Are these enemies close to Jasper?

Mending isn't anything like Yes, so if we were to like They could explode Mending isn't anything like Assembling an automaton I can't just cast my spell And it assembles itself all together It's more of like fixing a tear Or a break But what I might be able to do Is if we could Is if one of you could like pin it Near the wall or near the gears I could like mend it to where it's supposed to be Right?

I could mend one of its gears To the forge area And try to get it stuck on there Or you could probably Mend it Or we could just blow it up Or we could just blow it up Or you could Mend its system To not kill us So I Like I explained It is quite literally a mend Like I fix a tear in a book Or a page I can't assemble things It's not a fix It's not like fix this It is a just attack it It is a literally like sew together If you leave one alive I can try to rewire it Um Okay So Lunara's going to Go over to that fun orb And try to thaw that one Okay Great, what could go wrong?

What could go wrong?

Can you use your own dice?

They're right here 12 Alright So this is a Slight of hand check to pick up the orb And throw it before it explodes 12 13 13 Can I throw it?

You manage to pick it up and Throw it but you don't hit the Oh wait you got a 13?

Yeah And you hit one of the Flying creatures with it Which one is the most damaged?

They're kind of clumsily flying They're just like hovering Which one is the most damaged?

The one that's probably Slowed down and frozen here Okay, it explodes But there's something I have to throw at that one Do even more damage It explodes, it fails its Dexterity saving throw Takes 7 points Of damage and is slowed Yay Slowed twice And if I want to be nasty I'm going to try to Pin it Can you?

Pin it?

Yes because it's so slow It's slow jump That would be your next move though Alright Malric Malric do you want to revire it?

Not in combat I'm going to use the javelin That I made Can you get the \+1 From his rod?

Can you get the \+1?

Not while you're Not in combat Throw your javelin I'm attempting to strike The More damage Strike it in a way where it Pings it against the wall If you don't move you get to do sneak attack Sneak attack with my javelin?

Yeah It's called steady aim I think I think you're right Yeah steady aim gives you advantage on the attack And then you can sacrifice it I can use my extra move to gain advantage On the attack I'm pretty sure If you reduce your move to 0 As a bonus action you give yourself an advantage On your next attack roll That current turn provided you have a move during your turn As you use it your speed is 0 until the end of the turn But I'm not going to do sneak attack I'm going to do steady aim Steady aim gives you advantage Advantage gives you sneak attack Sneak attack does not cost a bonus action What does sneak attack do?

Extra damage It modifies your attack to where you do extra damage It doesn't cost anything But it has a requirement Can't you do it?

What is a sneak attack?

You can deal an extra 2d6 Damage to one creature here with an attack If you have advantage in the attack roll And the attack uses a finesse arranged weapon You're using a javelin So it's ranged?

An extra damages type is the same as weapons type I don't need advantage If I have at least one of my allies Who's within 5 feet of the target I have advantage I'm going to throw the javelin I need advantage So roll 2d20 And pick your higher one Can't you do a party finesse?

What am I adding to this?

You're going to add dex Dex plus proficiency Plus javelins I'll probably choose the 30/20 over the nat one Malrek has been kind of like watching Watching, wait for it And you throw the javelin And it spikes through the thing Pinning it against the wall How much damage do you do?

That's a great question 1d6 I want to say No, they're definitely more than that Are javelins the small ones or the big ones?

Wait, which one do you throw at the last day?

If you hit a creature with a javelin and deal damage to the creature You can reduce its speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn Yes, but that's not Well, it's pinned right now Which one do you throw at?

The undamaged one, right?

Nevermind, 1d6 for your turn 1d6, but then I roll 2 more 2d6 2 more d6 And then you add your 4 1d6, 2d6 So 3d6 plus my dexterity modifier 16 And was this against the damaged one or the not damaged one?

It explodes Sorry, the not damaged one 16, it does not explode No One of them just attempted to hit but did not manage to hit The javelin that you made on the forge seems to do full damage to this thing So you do the full 16 points of damage to it Now they both look equally wrecked and yes they are both bloodied However that works, they have oil Are they close to each other?

Would you be able to finish them off today with a...

They're relatively close to one another I'm going to...

Bryce, would you be willing to throw away the screens?

Thank you I'm going to run up to the frozen one, or the slowed one And I'm going to push it a little bit Over to the other one The one that's pinned I'm going to push it over and then cast mend on both of them Mending them to each other And sticking them to each other Which will hopefully, if not kill them Just make them totally useless So I'm going to try to do that Is that just going to be the mend or should I do it like an athletic show?

First you've got to hit the first one With the show?

You've got to hit the first one with the show And is that an athletics check?

That is just a to hit roll With our game modifier?

Strength or Dexterity That's not good You can kill them in one turn That's not a great roll That's not a great roll That's going to be I mean it's not terrible I don't think Is that a...

Do I have my proficiency?

Yes Proficiency in shoving objects?

It's just your level, it just gives you a bonus to everything It's just because I'm not in my proficiency bonus Third level To my to hit roll I rolled a 9 That's going to be 12 You can use your strength or your dexterity Whichever is higher Plus your proficiency bonus Oh so I should be getting \+6 to hit Yes You did Because it's a touch attack that's enough to shove it I always thought proficiency was like if you're proficient with using the weapon Well it is And you are So you're proficient with using your hands Yeah that's kind of just a natural thing If there is a specific weapon that you don't know how to use And you're not proficient with using it Okay Alright then And then I'm going to cast mending I don't... or mend I don't know if that requires... let me check Um Puzzle features No spells No that's not...

Oh I should realize I need to be adding initiative features to my roll I need to be adding initiative features to my roll Um Ooh I should be using my other stuff I have not been using any of this Um Is this spell list?

No no not my spell list It doesn't tell me exactly what mend does But But I'm going to assume that I Know from spell description that I am Alright It's basically just like a soldering tool Uh As the two injured Gear methods are forcibly shoved together And subjected to the magical effects of mending The situation spirals out of control With catastrophic results So I did kind of forget the fact that they do explode When you touch them The two constructs initially begin to spark and shudder as the magic attempts to reconcile Their incompatible forms The whirring of misaligned gears grows into a deafening screech Echoing like nails on a chalkboard throughout The chamber Their individual cores designed to power a single Creature start to resonate wildly Their energy fields clash violently And they explode Um What DC reflux?

DC 13 reflex check For anyone who's nearby It's going to be like you and you probably A and 9 11 Okay You both take 7 points of damage However You both are destroyed both of Um It is still intact It's made of hearty stuff Um Can you mend Can you mend again Can I mend my health No I can do medicine No Lunara the gears kind of vanished When they Yeah actually can you um Very helpful if you could do a medicine check Or healing spell on me Well do you have um land hands right Does anyone have cure wounds or Yeah he has land hands right I think Lunara has some cure Heal spells He does not actually He has a yes he does Those are his spells Land hands is not his spells Oh it's a different thing Heal spell or not heal spell Count as what Um I don't think so I think they are Of the type elemental Aw Do I not have it He does land hands You have a full healing power that Will be long raced that will restore a total 15 HP As much as you can touch a creature And give it as many of those points as you would like You know um Can I just use medicine Is there a way I can cause I'm proficient So it's not a skill check you can just do that Oh yeah He's asking if he can do it without wasting his pool Um what's the question I don't think so but if you have like medicine kits You can do that Would he I'm not from like medicine kits So he has a few options he has a medicine kit You can also take a short rest and just use your He has a medicine kit And he can use a medicine check I think To do something with that I don't know what he would do But he can do it Um and then the And then he has lay on hands Which has a 15 point pool That he can use his bone section to just like Lay on hands the person and heal them Okay Those are our options right now or we can short rest If you short rest you can use As many hit die as you want to Restore health This is true and also I don't think we have a Um I think we're kind of Trying to move through These things I don't know if we realistically Have like an hour to Well I think if we just like Continue and not min max every single Scenario then I think that would be good Can I check on Barth is he is he doing okay Is he he's kind of like He's He's primarily worried about The kind of forged machinery That looks like it's still in pretty bad Shape It's not you who needs to like hunt hands I've never seen them before You don't need it I've never seen them before Have you seen a new drow running around here You can give 8 to me and 7 to him I have yes You should give Give me 4 and give me Let's get these I'm gonna give you 7 I'm gonna give you 4 I'm a frontline tiger as opposed to him So you can go up to 12 and I can go up To 18 Is that fine with you Now do I not get it anymore Not till you next long Yes, so it's not a spell but Yes, your pool is defeated Which means you can't do anything I need another long rest before I can do that And that's a long rest not sure Does anyone have guidance No, none of us are clerics I believe I have guidance I have druidic I mean I have guide which and it's The what My background is guide And to initiate druid The two spells that I have are Guidance and The other one I thought You can at will outside of combat give anyone \+1d4 to any skill check ever Yeah that's what Guidance does Yes, it's guidance and it was The other one that we said So wait can I see what does it do He can use He can like call on the power of Nature Yeah, no it's resistance guidance And elementalism I know I'm trying to figure out what it does though It lets you add 1d4 To any skill check And then have one starter as the It's a spell He can cast it whenever he wants As many times as he wants Whenever anyone is Rolling a skill check Alright, so you're done with the healing Malarik had questions for Bark We're fairly Healed up Can we move to the next thing Have you seen any drow With a noble come across this area I have Seen the drow but The machinery We must fix it Would you like to make a different sleight of hand check Let me try to do that again How about How about Doesn't your Magic deck give you advantage on Sleight of hand checks Yeah but I thought that was I thought that was only using the magic May I cast Yes, absolutely So I get to add it You already gave me it And sleight of hand is plus 8 So 23 Alright So You managed to kind of like Figure things out and you're able to Before what was happening is like everything is still moving So as you were trying to put the gears in they like Flew back out of it But as you've kind of figured it out you start spinning The gear before you push it in and that works The final gear slides into place With a resonant click that seems to echo through the very bones Of the forge for a moment all is still Then a deep harmonic humming begins to build From somewhere far below the floor The massive clockwork engine Shudders decades of dust cascading from its surface As each gear begins to turn slowly At first and then with gathering momentum The sound is extraordinary hundreds of Interlocking pieces moving in perfect synchronization Creating a symphony of metal and motion that feels Less like machinery and more like music Steam vents release in perfect timed bursts Adding their voice to the mechanical chorus The forges heart blazes to life with Unprecedented clarity Do do do do do The entire Fire wall becomes a mesmerizing dance of Light and shadow each gear casting Precise patterns that overlap and combine In possible ways at the center of it all The mechanistic lens emerges from its Long sealed chamber rotating slowly As it rises within the machinery Barth watching from Nearby whispers in awe By the ancestors I have never seen it Working at its full potential before this This is what the high elves built Imagine the kind of telescope You could make with those lenses Ooooo Sorry Intriguing Hey, I have a theory What if you put like, you know the Things that make you go really fast Yeah, the speed rooms are then amplified by the things What if you threw those on the lenses Alright, do you wanna Is someone gonna try to Take the lens Oh, I'll take the lens, I don't have one yet Alright, you need to make a skill check And you have some choices Hey, can you cast?

Sure Max, here's your choice The only reason you wouldn't be able to use it is if you're like Rolling deception and you just have some guy in the corner Being like, I cast And the enemy's like What is this guy doing?

Then maybe you shouldn't It's just your hype guy standing next to you Like, yeah, yeah No cap, yeah You could use it for like a distraction Max, here are your choices Alright, your choices You can use any of the following Skills for your mechanistic Athletics, sleight of hand Arcana History, investigation You don't have a history, Max, you have wisdom Well, he has a history of four You have a sleight of hand of eight And he has an arcana of eight Well, he's picking, Max is the one picking it up I'm the one doing it So, athletics, sleight of hand Arcana Investigation Oh yeah I mean, honestly Four is like my best You could use history Or arcana So history, I'll choose history Why would I use arcana?

You know how AI can make images?

I wonder how long It's gonna be until AI can make 3D Like, I know it probably Already is a little bit, but like If you could have it make like a 3D Room and hook it up to like a 3D model Like a VR People are working on Self-generating video games Which is basically like a 3D room that generates itself So, I have the same I have \+4 in proficiency In arcana and history Which one?

\[Multiple voices talking at once\] It's a 9?

Okay, so you go up and you reach for it And you're trying to like Bring it down and you get thrown back 10 feet Make a DC13 dexterity check And you get \+4 points of damage Roll a d20 This is your \+1 Okay, so you land on your feet You're just kind of like Tossed back by the \[Multiple voices talking at once\] Alright, you can try it again \[Multiple voices talking at once\] Okay, this time you're thrown back 20 feet, DC15 dexterity Or you take 7 points of damage \[Multiple voices talking at once\] You're slammed against the back wall And you comically slide Slowly down into crumpled heap You're unconscious From the blow He takes 7 points of damage from that I roll my eyes and grab the orb Okay, are you gonna use slide of hand?

I need a slide of hand What are the possible rolls for it?

What do you mean?

Like the like That or arcana I don't need any guidance I'm just gonna roll it Wait, didn't I have guidance?

Uh, 11 Wait, guidance gives you \+4, right?

For the first one, I didn't cast it for any other time Oh, I don't think I added this I don't need guidance, I got a dirty 11 Uh, you are knocked back Roll DC13 dexterity check Okay, well this is also \+4 So can I do anything?

Cause I'm kinda like It's \+6 actually Why is it \+6?

I'm gonna give Max a good pat on the back I'd wake him up Um, alright 15 You are able to, it almost begrudgingly Let's go Oh, the saving throw 15 you take no damage So wait, what are the mechanistic Arcana Mechanistic, please hold Athletics for Physical precision Slide of hand for precise manipulation Arcana For knowledge of magical systems History for focus on technological Or historical advancement of crafted wonders Investigation for analytical Problem solving Hey, Max got two tries I think I should get a second try So I'm gonna try to do slide of hand again Attempt 4 Yay, I got a 26 Alright, 26, absolutely You figured it out It only took knocking out teammate and blasting me backwards And then you get blasted backwards anyways cause pushing away from you I understand now I only care Somebody's watching Me Six times later I understand now Alright Four times, you can take us a whole six Only one knockout He handed it to Max He handed it to me so I can have one He handed it to Prismar but Prismar's unconscious Does anyone else have good medicine so we can make them conscious again?

You're the unconscious one, Max Anyone else have good medicine?

Just stick it in my backpack while I'm unconscious I think you've got good medicine, right, Bryce?

I'm just gonna give him a good slap in the face Bryce, what's your medicine?

Medicine is plus five Proficiency What spells do you have?

Let's use that No, no, just do medicine I won't heal him but I'll heal him I'm just curious what spells he has He has spells That's everything in spellbook, not as prepared as well Okay, nine, six, so fifteen Fifteen, you wake up Fourteen You wake up and you have a ringing headache Cool, now can you stick it in my backpack?

It is the second level of the condition It is the second level of the condition But is he awake?

Yeah, I'm awake, I just have a headache Yeah, I'm awake, I just have a headache He has cure wounds prepared Oh, that's the list That's the P-mage Yes So Bryce could cast cure wounds Or cure wounds rather As a first level spell to heal him But it does not that I don't think it's that bad I remind you what die is it cure wounds That's a Mechanistic wounds Can somebody heal me?

What die is it cure wounds?

Can I use medicine please?

So Bryce can roll plus five medicine Bryce already rolled it I'm conscious Okay Great So Thank you What is medicine?

Can I roll it to heal?

I'm conscious Hold on, pause Medicine helps when you take a long rest But it doesn't like in the moment heal If you want to in the moment heal You can spend hit die Or you can cast a spell or you can drink a potion So if he is unconscious you don't want to wake him up He's woken up Lunara rolled a medicine Woke him up So everyone is awake You've got the Mechanistic lens It is getting Late It is getting close to midnight So can you give me the lens And then we can go and like So we have four lenses One left Yeah I'll give the lens to Max Yeah I'll hand it to Max I take it and they don't blow up this time Verdant, Celestial Displacement One more Where would it be?

Like we have to guess What are the places we haven't explored so far?

Obviously the Yeah where's the last one?

There's the song hall, the embassy Can I do one more?

Can we go and like take a long rest?

So it is getting close to midnight And you know from your studies That midnight is when the dawn's crown Convergence happens which occurs Only once every hundred years Yes so we We don't want to miss it I don't know if we have all five yet But I don't know if we have enough time to get them Before midnight if we think they're that important I think What's the chance Where would we think the next one would be?

If we had to guess I would say either the song hall Or the Is there a meeting contest or was I making that up?

That does exist But I don't know which either could be Roll an arcana check Can I roll something after?

Arcana check 26 Whoa, Harmony is the Fifth essence From my studies of the Orrery Up in the Observatory The fifth element should be Harmony So if we can get the I lost my accent there for a second If we can get to the What is that?

That's when you fixed the Oh When I fixed it I think the fifth element should be Harmony which would Can I roll a history To try and find it?

Like where it is?

That wouldn't be in history And also it is I mean the root of Harmony seems like It seems like it would be in the The music place The song hall Maybe we could try and figure that out But again it is getting close to midnight I don't know if we have enough time I think we just go We can try and figure out where that area is Underneath the castle That seems like where things might converge Or we can go to the embassy or we can go to the dance contest I'd go to the song hall and just pick up the fifth one Cause that means when we go to We should collect all five before we move on Can I roll a history to see what this Festival, like about the Hundred year thing is about If we do need all five Like what it has to do with the ones Is the question History That one You know nothing You know something But it's wrong You've realized you can't Confirm where you are Or what your name is You get knocked unconscious a second time You're still a little woozy Yeah it's because of the headache Take a second History check Would he know Would you like to Wait it's a five because But it's a nat one so it doesn't matter Nat one is automatic failure, it doesn't mean anything specifically bad You see the The halfling boy pokes his head in Oh wow, gosh I've never seen this Not for a while at least It's been some time, but What time is it?

Oh you must hurry hurry The convergence is almost upon us What Where do we go?

I forget The big room in the middle Out of Okay, right Out of, maybe you should wait Before you roll next time You should announce what you're going to roll before you roll it I was going to roll history But what did you get?

You need to announce it first and also you got a one So Out of character Do you know where I know where to go, right?

Is there a spot that we go to see the alignment?

There are Gosh Isn't there A door in the library?

How about we pin him against the wall And hand us our money Of course, you're right I suppose We should have that straight away even if we don't have All the things necessary I have a suggestion I've seen you like, I don't like this guy Who keeps poking his head in Should we do something to get rid of him?

He's been nothing But helpful He's been nothing but helpful, Mark But he's a little annoying If we took Everyone who was over He's been totally keeping us on track He's helped us with every single one But he's a little bit Annoying So we're going to beat him up And tell him to hand us his gold We will equally Distribute the gold You're being a little bit annoying right now You're being a little bit annoying Yeah Let's speed this up guys Let's go I suppose we should go in there With the music festival So can you tell how long Do you think we would have enough time Can you not mess with my phone, thank you Do you think we would have enough time to go to a Music festival before Midnight or no Zap, the convergence is closing Wait, like it's already happening And it's closing or You must, you must hurry, hurry The stars make a path Just like the one under your feet Like some twinkling lights We're going to follow that path, we're going to go to the room Going in front of you We're going to run to the light We're going to use the speed rune Speed runes on all the boots You're going to Roll out my Disc of deception We have boots and Disc of displacement Let's see, for displacement You have some choices Do do do do Acrobatics, sleight of hand Stealth Investigation For displacement For activating displacement I would like to activate We would like to do both Sleight of hands That's funny You all get in like A little conga line with you at the front And you just like That's our train That was pretty speedy You rocket into the Into the library Sorrel had grabbed onto the Back and was like I think Marge keeps the oldest maps third shelf from the bottom Behind the astronomy text A lever Okay, I rush over there as good as I can I'm assuming I know where that is because I work in the library I will rush over there And pull the lever crunk You see the door slide across And behind is a very dusty Set of stairs leading down Can we ask if he has any other Is it like a spiral staircase It's just more like a straight That's pretty nice Does anyone have like a wooden board that we can slide down The stairs on I don't think we need to go that fast We're only going fast enough Just keep holding on Just keep holding on to the conga line The conga line down the stairs We're supposed to go wrong Does anyone have any shields?

No We just We just place our way down to the Down the stairs Alright At the bottom of the stairs You pull the lever You find an ancient doorway Ancient doorway Right into it While we're going at full speed Yes You make a Tremendous clang It's metal Yes Wait so what did the lever do again?

The lever opened this Secret door in the library Then you went down these stairs And you are at a Giant metal door and behind you You hear like a humming kind of sound Is there like a lock on the door?

You can Search I'd like to threaten my friend How about we just open The door?

How about we just take Sorlum Bang and pet against it 13+5 is 18?

18 investigation You notice that there is A set of Release latches around it that you think you might Be able to activate with your sleight of hand I would like to activate With my sleight of hand You gonna be \+1 on this?

I say we take the It's the d4 \+1d4 2 5 No \+8 is 13 13?

You think you're making some Progress but you're not quite there Can I do it?

We have a heat metal spell You feel like A tugging from the lens in your bag I pull out my lens Through the lens you can You think you can see The mechanism I'm gonna use it to Guide me as I try to Wait can you use guidance?

And guidance You have 5 reciting 18 total The door clanks And opens What about my croc?

The ancient doorway groans open Releasing a breath of air that carries the weight of centuries The chamber beyond stretches upward into darkness But your attention is immediately drawn To the heart of the sanctum Where an impossibly complex mechanical marvel Dominates the space The great orrery of Everpeak Except you don't have 5 lenses Suspended in midair massive rings of copper and silver Slowly rotate their surfaces etched With countless runes that pulse with competing Lights Crystal lenses of various sizes catch and reflect To magical energies creating a dance of colored light The chamber's carved walls But something is wrong The usual harmonious motion appears erratic With some sections spinning too quickly while others grind To near halts On the raised dais before the orrery's core Lord Alric stands with his arms raised His crimson trimmed cloak billowing In the artificial wind created by the chaotic energies The stolen frozen iron key Gleams darkly in his grip Beside him the lead draw Envoy works with focused intensity Placing crude replacement lenses into ancient mounting points The air crackles with unstable powers As the dawn's crown alignment approaches Can someone shoot him?

I would like to bash him on the ground Alric's barrier of twisted essences Surrounds him A swirling maelstrom of nature's green Mechanisms silver, celestial gold, displacements violet And harmonies rose all warring with each other Instead of flowing into their intended patterns The very air feels wrong As if reality itself is being pulled In too many directions at once Can we shoot him?

Suddenly, a familiar voice rings out from behind you, but different now, resonating with power that no halfling child should possess.

They break what they cannot understand, Sorrel declares, his form beginning to shimmer with golden light.

Show them what true harmony means.

The luminous ethereal figure composed of swirling star fields and cosmic dust glides silently, trailing most radiance behind it, its eyes shimmer with otherworldly light.

It has an initiative of seven.

It is a starlight mephid.

Why?

Spelled.

You can just say starlight.

Mephid.

Mephid.

That's where the baddies go.

What was its initiative?

It was a seven.

So below all of us is a seven.

Yeah, I was a fourteen.

Alright.

The drow points a finger at you.

Me?

And fires off a magic missile.

It's not like I slapped you last turn.

Magic missile's what, 3d4?

3?

It's 1d4 plus 1 per missile, which is 3 at level 1 spell, and then increases by 1 missile per leveled spell above it.

Yeah, he's just got the one.

The first missile smacks you for 4\.

The second one smacks you for 3\.

And the third one smacks you for 4\.

So they don't even roll us to hit?

Magic missile always hits.

I'm down to 7\.

Next up is Malric.

Yes.

Are they standing on like a pillar or something, or is it just in the middle of a room?

They're kind of in the middle of a room, yeah.

Okay, so there's no, okay.

Fireball\!

I will...

I would like to cast...

Witch Bolt.

Alright.

On the one that's been hit in the face.

The Drow, yeah.

Are there only one Drow, or is there multiple?

There's Drow Mage.

There's one Drow Mage, and there's the king, that's it?

Yeah, yeah.

And then there's the Starlight guy.

I would like to catch Witch's Bolt on the Drow.

Alright.

Is that a to hit or a save?

It's a save.

Jordan, can you help me?

What is it?

It says save plus 5\.

What does it say?

It's a range of 60\.

Where is this?

It's a concentration spell.

Witch Bolt is... no, that's just save slash attack.

It is going to be an attack roll against it.

Is there no to hit?

Yeah, the attack roll is your to hit.

So you roll a d20.

And it's plus 5?

Plus, I think your intelligence, plus your proficiency.

What's my proficiency?

It's always plus 2\.

So it's plus 3 plus 2, which is plus 5\.

So spell attack bonus is plus 5, that's what it says here.

Yeah, yeah.

So I roll this and I add 5\.

Oh, that's why it says plus 5\.

I definitely didn't...

I get a 15\.

That's a hit.

Oh, nice.

What is Witch Bolt's damage?

Witch Bolt's damage?

May I see?

Oh, here's the... actually I've got a Celestial.

Oh, okay.

A little more like that.

Made of stars.

I guess it's more of a method than an elemental.

How much damage is Witch Bolt doing now?

I don't know.

One second.

Witch Bolt is 2d12.

The stars when he casts out some 2d light, it all depends.

Can I have a second?

I have another...

On a hit, your target takes 2d12.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a bonus action to deal 1d12.

You can take a bonus action to deal 1d12.

Yes. 1d12 is this.

There's this.

That's a 9\.

So I deal 16 damage.

Whoa, he's down.

He's down?

He's just down, yeah.

I mean, he doesn't explode easy.

And are you going to align a lens?

I would love to align a lens using sight of hands.

Okay.

Let me look.

Sight of hands.

You can either do mechanistic through precision manipulation or displacement through misdirection.

Both have already been... done, though.

You feel like you can do as many of any of them as you want.

Okay.

So mechanistic, we saw his shield shatter a little bit?

Or...

Every time you've tuned a lens, it's kind of like pulled a layer off of it.

Okay, I would like to do dissection, or the displacement.

Okay.

So I just...

I think I suggest one layer, but pull displacement.

Did you want guidance on that or no?

12, and you were doing displacement?

Yes.

Blue sparks come off and a...

Can you...let me roll initiative.

On an initiative of 12, you now have a blink method.

That's the same guy who you were fighting before, I believe.

In the hallway, yes.

Alright.

So it turns out not one, but just 12 is no different.

Prismar\!

This is a 12, so...

Can I, like, convince him...

Does Widges Bull have to be on the same target if I recast it?

Can you try to convince him?

Like, I can recast every kind of a bonus action.

You can try...

What would I need to get?

Well, here's the thing.

This lord has spent the last three years plotting this very moment.

Seems unlikely that he could convince him to see the evil in his ways and stop.

If I roll the nat 20...

Theoretically.

If you rolled two nat 20s in a row...

Which is a 1 in 400 chance.

Or you could align a lens with your free action.

Or you could do both.

I think I'll go for the 1 in 400\.

What's your highest roll?

6 with medicine.

What would medicine roll?

What other high rolls does he have?

6 is the highest.

With medicine, you can align nature through healing with natural remedies or harmony with group-focused restoration.

He has nature, so you should do harmony because no one has harmony.

That makes sense.

Do harmony with nature?

That makes sense.

Which one do I have?

Mechanistic, which you've already done.

Not to say it wouldn't still help, but...

Are you going to do the same thing that Jordan tried, where you use your free action for one and then you use the lens for full action for another?

I have no idea.

I'm not sure.

We have to pull the shield away from the bad guy before we can do anything?

Or you could try and kill either the boy or the starlight for sure.

One action, bonking somebody.

So align the harmony lens.

Hold on.

It takes a full action to use your lens.

If you're successful, you will get a double, but you have to use a...

Which lens do you have?

The mechanistic?

So you would need to use the skill associated with the mechanistic as that full action.

So if you want the free action and an attack.

Because you want to bop them on the head.

So during your turn, you have an action which you can use to either attack or use your lens.

Which lens should I...

Do the harmony because no one's done it.

It's up to you.

There is no...

Hold on.

There is no right answer.

What do you think the orrery should be aligned more towards?

Like what he should have?

What essence do you think there should be more of?

For us, it's gonna be...

Just...

I think there should be more nature.

Alright, go for it.

Can I use...

Can I do nature?

So you roll a d20 and you add your nature score.

I'll let Bryce do it.

Hold on.

Anyone can do anyone that they want.

It is an individual decision.

If you want to do nature, do nature.

So roll a d20, add your medicine.

So it's 14\.

Ah, 14 so close.

What kind of method is this?

A verdant method.

Oh, the El Michael thing.

So you need to roll above a 15\.

A 15 roll.

Verdant method appears with an initiative of 16\.

We'll just pick it up the next time it comes around.

16?

What did you get?

Can you write it on both sides?

You see a small, say like imp like impish creature woven from vines, leaves, and moss.

Flowers bloom around its feet, but when angered, thorny vines lash out viciously.

It appears mischievous, yet protective.

It's also very adorable.

Can I see?

Max.

I'll put Val here, and then can I have the one that's on the ground now?

Thank you.

Okay.

Okay, good.

Or perhaps this one if you'd like to do it.

What's the, can I see both of them?

This is important.

Where's that one?

It seems easy.

Oh yeah, you never, um.

I like that one better.

Alright.

So you managed to summon a Verdant Method with your bonus action, and now you can choose to use your full action on anything else that you would like.

So can I poke the one I just summoned?

You can.

Wait, is it angered?

It is angered.

At us?

Yes.

Well, that's a good question.

Roll a Perception.

Roll a what?

Perception.

Can I?

Lunara asked the question.

I get a...

Thank you.

It does not appear to be angered at you, it just appears to be angered.

No, I mean angered at our group.

Correct.

It's angered at in general.

In general.

It's angered at both us and the bad guys.

And maybe the other methods.

Method war.

Okay.

Next is...

Can I...

I still...

It's still Prismar, so you can take your action to try to align a lens using the lens, or you can run up and attack.

I want to use Nature's Wrath.

What does that do?

It's a magic action.

You can expand one use of channel divinity to conjure spectral lines around each creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet.

Each creature must succeed on a DC on a DC11 strength saving or have the restrained condition for one minute.

The restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns ending the effect on itself on a success.

What is the DC?

Sorry. 11 strength.

Can I pick all of the creatures?

Yes.

You can pick up all the creatures and they need to roll... what is it?

DC11 strength.

So the Verdant method attempts to roll a natural 20\.

It is made of vines so I think that makes sense.

The Starlight method fails.

And the Blink method also rolls a natural 20\.

I get to see the big guy too in the center.

It doesn't appear to be affecting him.

Can I... oh we killed the other guy.

Yes.

So you do manage to capture the Starlight method and now what's the condition?

It's now restrained which means speed is 0 attack rolls against you have advantage and your attack rolls have disadvantage.

Nice.

And you have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws.

Nice.

Okay so you captured one of them in your claws.

Alright now the Verdant method gets to go.

So wait, so I got one of them.

How many are there?

There are three of them.

So far.

So I get one?

Yes.

So I wasted that.

It's not wasted.

It's not wasted.

You got one.

And that guy can't move towards us.

Okay so it gets to go and it launches a barrage of magically charged thorns at you but it has disadvantage.

Why?

Because it is restrained.

Oh the Verdant one is not restrained.

Nevermind.

Wait why is it mad there?

He gets a 20 to hit and does 5 piercing damage to you.

Wait to me?

Yes.

Lunara. 5 piercing damage.

I'm going to attempt to now 60 to do the method I'm trying to work for us.

I'm worrying about dying.

I'm going to use nature.

Okay.

Okay.

I get a what am I at now?

How many damage?

15\.

15?

You get a 15 on nature.

The Verdant method appears to turn its rage from you towards Lord Elric.

Are you going to try to align a lens?

And if so what essence would you like to align?

What skill are you using?

What's your highest?

So for harmony nature.

For harmony your options are insight, medicine, deception, intimidation, or performance.

You can do the nature one though.

I'm going to do medicine.

What's your medicine?

Medicine gives nature or harmony.

Okay.

Harmony. 13 plus 5\.

That is 18\.

18?

Alright.

You align a lens towards harmony and another.

So we only have nature and celestial left right?

You don't think it works that way.

You don't think it's like a one of each.

You think it is just you are making decisions about how the power should be distributed.

Yes?

How thin is this magic shield?

It looks to be about half gone.

So how many successes did you get?

So all around we have one of everything.

Okay.

The blink mephit goes next.

And the blink mephit was not entrapped.

So No the blink mephit is.

What did you do for the bird?

And the blink mephit.

He used his nature and he rolled a 15\.

And he converted the two aside.

So the blink mephit hurls a crystalline fragment of warped space that seems to bend light around it.

Again?

Yes.

We've been through this.

At who?

Who has been, who has attacked them?

Attacked him.

No one has.

Well I mean the vines came from Prismar but other than that.

Alright.

At Lord Elric it shatters against the force field.

Alright.

Starlight is restrained.

Starlight is restrained but let's see if they've got a ranged attack.

Do do do do do.

So you need to do a double feature.

I can only do one of one.

Alright.

Alright.

Prismar, the mephit channels celestial power in a cone of sparkling starlight.

You must succeed on a constitution saving throw DC 13\.

Constitution plus two.

Seven.

Okay.

You take seven points of radiant damage.

No.

You take seven points of radiant damage and you start glowing.

Giving advantage to anybody who attacks you.

And is there what are these celestial skills?

I don't think I've taken a single point of damage.

Nope.

Nope.

Alright.

We're back to back to Val.

What are the celestial skills?

The celestial skills.

If we survive this I'm gonna kill.

Arcana religion perception performance.

Okay.

So perception would be risk with them for that and then what else?

But again I should emphasize this is like as the gold dragon sings his song of ancient power.

Yeah.

It's it's.

You have a feeling that it is is not one of everything.

It is just.

It is not necessarily one of everything but also you did say that we are deciding how the power is balanced.

What if I snag his lens?

Like can I just grab it from his.

Well I should ask what essence does your character think there should be more of?

Um.

So my best skill is the displacement.

So as a courier do you feel like there should be more displacement energy?

Yes.

So I what I was going to do is pre action displacement.

I'm the displacement guy.

Yes but my best drill is stealth and stealth is only displacement.

Correct.

Yeah.

Okay.

So I can so if I snagged Jordan's thing I could then roll perception for the celestial.

Okay.

And do two.

Okay.

So the first one is going to be.

You're a wise guy too you know.

Yeah exactly.

Your name is Long.

Signifies intelligence.

My wisdom.

Gonna be yeah plus three.

Um.

A stealth rule to get the displacement.

Okay.

Plus six.

That is the wrong guy.

Do you want to cast guidance on yourself for that?

I think so.

It's a bonus action.

It's a concentration spell though.

I don't know if you'd be able to do more than that once.

I'm gonna.

I'm gonna use my magic rod.

I'll look it up.

It's a bonus action.

Get Rod.

Get Rod of God.

It's a bonus action so I believe you can do that.

Get Rod of God.

Oh no it's an action to cast it so no you can't.

Okay.

Cool.

I will roll this at eight plus six for displacement.

Yeah seventeen.

Seventeen.

You align a lens to displacement.

And then I'm going to quickly grab but stay within reach the celestial lens and roll perception.

You get to do advantage on this one.

Plus three.

Nice.

Perception plus three.

We're gonna go with the fourteen plus three seventeen again.

Okay.

The lens lifts out of your hands and joins into the spinning orrery and light strikes it.

Okay.

Lovely.

It did something.

I understand.

So the lenses we gathered were not necessarily unique parts of the five lens set but part of this whole orrery that has many lenses and so we can use them to increase the power.

Correct.

And so that's your turn Pocky.

I'm going to first use my free action to channel a arcana into celestial.

Okay.

Wait why are she doing that?

Which would be if I'm correct that would be our sixth success.

If I get this.

And that's gonna be plus eight.

Is there anything else I can do?

No I don't think so.

Not really.

Okay.

That's a 21\.

Okay.

That's celestial you said?

Yes.

Alright.

With that the please hold your calls.

Alright.

With that the final strands of the barrier that we're protecting Alric fade away.

Right now it's his turn.

No no.

I haven't done it.

I've done my free action.

I haven't done anything else yet.

He enters combat with a five.

Okay.

So is there any baddies left from the original group?

Because he's actually in this group.

No the baddie I think was just the drow.

Yeah.

Okay.

We can just shift all of this over.

Sure.

Bop.

Bop.

Alright what do you want to do for your own actions?

I am going to um run up to Lord Alric on his little platform.

And as I do it I'm going to say you are disrespecting the the arts of the the orvary and the the whole synod.

You are disrupting the magic flows.

And you are twisting knowledge to your power.

This will not stand.

And I will run up to him and I'm going to grab my quarter staff and just like deck him with it.

I'm going to just like absolutely deck him with it.

That is going to be um 1d8 um with the quarter staff.

Okay.

Using it versatile.

Um and I'm going to roll to hit.

Um that's going to be a 21 to hit.

That hits him.

Sorry. 20 to hit.

Yeah that still hits him.

Okay cool.

Um then I will that's going to deal some damage.

Um that's going to be 1d8 and that's going to be 10 damage.

Alright.

And then he's going to make a constitution saving throw.

Why?

Um.

Cause he decked him.

Oh sorry sorry.

No that's not going to be that's not going to be 10 damage.

That's going to be no that is going to be 10 damage.

Um Uh let's see.

Right he's going to make a where is it?

It's somewhere.

Wait you got a 10 on 1d10?

Uh no it's d8.

And then.

And what if you modify for damage?

One second.

High speed.

Where is it?

Where is it?

Where is it?

You could also use a savage tap.

That is what I did.

So I get to roll the d8 twice and then use that higher roll.

Um.

Can you give me guidance?

Oh right sorry it's a weapon of proficiency on the thing.

Topple on the quarter staff.

Um which I have forgotten what it does.

Um topple if I uh gotcha.

So that's going to be a um DC 15 constitution saving throw.

Alright.

Or else what?

He gets knocked over?

Prone yes.

Constitution saving throw.

He's like giving me massive concussion.

Nine ten.

So he's knocked prone now.

Alright.

Knocked prone.

That'll teach you.

That'll teach you for disrespecting.

Alright.

Are we still channeling the things?

Or is that over?

I mean his shield's gone.

I'm sure he's still on hand.

Uh yes this channeling is still absolutely going on.

So for my free action I'm going to do slight of hand to channel uh displacement.

Okay.

Not one.

So you realize that someone's more than- Are you using your thing?

Your lens?

No I think that was his free action.

No that was his free action.

Okay.

Uh then now there are two blink methods.

Two?

So you realize when you fail it's another blink method right?

No I hadn't figured that out Jordan.

Are you going to use the lens?

If you do you get advantage.

That's his full action.

Um If he uses his full action for it.

Well it depends should I be shooting at a bad guy or no?

I would recommend it but you if you want to actually you know what I- Forgo that to add more displacement.

I wanna add more I think the world could use a little bit more displacement.

Okay so you roll advantage.

I'm not gonna shoot the lightning.

It's gonna be like you finish the fight and now there are no laws and everybody's running around stealing.

There's like eight guys so they might as well shoot at like- What did they roll?

Um in the shield?

I think they're gonna stay on the same.

Uh they're staying on the same.

The thing is if we kill the noble- Oh there's just one more.

So there's one more.

You said there are two now.

There are now two.

Okay so- I have two more.

Next roll advantage.

We'll see maybe you need a not the nat one.

We'll go with the- 19\.

19?

You're good at those nat ones.

It lifts out of your hands and clinks in and two beams shoot off into displacement.

Alright.

Uh two beams just from the distance.

Yeah.

And did that- It's twice as bright.

And did mine do that as well?

Yes.

Okay cool.

So that's three into celestial four into displacement.

It's s'mores o'clock\!

S'mores o'clock.

S'mores o'clock.

Can you wrap up in like five minutes?

Uh no but we can hit pause.

We can wrap up in like ten or fifteen probably.

Uh let's hit pause.

Do s'mores.

It'll be more fun that way and Grimps is standing out in the cold waiting for you with the fire going.

There is now four different methods waiting to come and kill us.

I think we should have the methods target the royal.

If we just kill the royal then they're gonna all- You guys are awesome.

Thank you for coming so quickly.

Well we can't choose who they target.

Yeah.

We chose which one the verdict targeted.

Yes.

If you wanted to perform like the cool card trick for the royal- That's so many cool images.

And not attack you that'd be great.

Do you think you can do that?

Okay okay.

Also can I- What's your opinion?

What's that?

Sorry.

On the watergate situation.

Um no um Can Keston like I guess not this turn is the use of action.

Can he use- You can still align a length of your reaction to add more energy of a certain type.

Um you can also um Lord Elrish's shield is now down.

Yeah just bash him over the head you know.

And so you can bash him over the head or Can you grab the table?

Um I decked him in the head and made him prone.

Um and so you can- Don't kill him yet.

We should uh And so you can- The whole 400 times in five days.

What if we just spam align all the disks until they're all aligned and then they've been aligned enough.

And then they kill us in the process?

Wait is it- So you said the displacement rune is the only one that's been aligned?

No.

I'm in line hell.

Okay so when you align the lens using one of the physical true lenses it's just twice as good.

So currently if my math is correct we have four like charges into displacement.

Three charges into celestial and then one into um nature and Was I able to notice anything?

One into um the mechanical whatever it was called.

And then one into harmony?

And one into nature.

But that's not important.

I think we should try to get one into the least every The harmony monster hasn't spawned.

No we have not gotten any harmony monsters yet.

Correct.

Wait I have a question.

Did Mallorca notice anything different when he aligned the two disks?

The shield had already gone down.

But we've seen the mech monster before.

Did he see that he was like making a difference or was he kind of just- Wait.

Um It was just No.

It didn't like there was no more power swirling around.

Can I just summon the mech but it's mine?

You want to deliberately fail a check?

Alright.

Prismar.

No I don't want to- It's Prismar's turn.

Bryce it's not your turn.

Can I just see the harmony thing?

Bryce it is not your prismar.

Bryce it is not your turn.

You just want to see it.

You just want to see it.

Let's see what the little banana can do.

Are they bright pink and fuzzy?

Am I bright pink and fuzzy?

No the harmony methods.

But we'll um Can we take some time?

Yeah bright pink and fuzzy.

Harmony methods.

Alright.

Can I speak with animals?

On what?

On the new friend who's made?

They are elementals.

They're not animals.

Not beasts.

But you can attack the Lord Elric because he is open and ready to be attacked.

He is pro.

He also pros you out of advantage.

Magic missile.

Do you want- I think your most damaging thing would be thunderous might.

And although magic missile always hits you have advantage against him because he's prone.

And so I think that would be the best.

So thunderous might?

I think so.

Kill it?

Do you have other smites?

Divine smite.

Divine smite, enduring strike.

Engineering strike.

That's not a smite though.

He has divine smite, thunderous might, divine smite, and divine smite.

So what does divine smite do?

Extra 2d6 thunder damage.

Additionally if the target is a creature must succeed on a strength saving throw it would be pushed 10 feet away from you.

So what does the divine smite do that isn't the thunderous might?

That is 2d8.

That is plus 2d8 holy damage with nothing else.

It is 2d8 radiant damage.

Increases by 1d8 if they're fiend or undead.

Shield of faith will increase someone's AC by 2 but it's more of a support spell and I think that would really need to weigh along.

AC is your armor.

Makes them more armored.

Lunara you're up after the verdant method.

But I think your best bet for now is going to be your regular divine smite because that's going to be the most damage.

Not ray of frost.

Ray of frost is way less.

So what you can do is you can swing your weapon at king elriff.

I think divine smite because thunderous might is 2d6 thunder but divine smite is 2d8. 2d8, I'll choose 2d8.

Okay so first you have to hit him so swing your great sword.

With advantage because he is prone.

So you run up.

You raise your great sword above you with two hands.

And two dice.

That's a 14 plus a 6\.

That's a hit for sure.

So 2d6 damage.

So you hit.

So 2d6 damage plus your strength. 2d8.

It's divine smite not thunderous.

Well 2d6 for the great sword.

Oh sorry. 2d6 plus 2d8 plus your strength. 2d8 plus your strength.

That seems insane.

Is this like a spell slot or could you do this every time?

Spell slot.

And melee spell slot I guess that makes sense.

Nice dude.

6, 6\.

That's 12\.

So put 7\.

19\. 19 plus 3\.

That is 22 damage. 22 damage that is a good chunk of damage.

And you gouge him.

You slice into him.

And your radiant bursts into him.

And he screams at you.

But he's still going.

No he is human.

What's that?

Can I apologize to him before I like it?

Yes you can.

Sorry I had to do this.

And do you want to align one of the lenses?

Yeah with the pre action.

We don't need to anymore but it is in history.

Okay guys.

Nature.

Think about it.

Okay so if you add an element it will increase the amount of the element in the world.

If you fail it adds a method.

Which is another thing that we have to kill.

I think.

Why not?

We should add some nature to the world.

Yes so that requires another skill check.

Okay hold on.

Chris Moore.

This is a question just for you.

Do you feel like there should be more of any of the essence in the world?

Any one of them?

Does any one of them speak to you?

Which one?

There is displacement.

Mechanistic.

Celestial.

Harmony.

Nature.

Mechanistic hasn't been done yet.

Mechanistic has been done.

So mechanistic or nature?

No nature hasn't been done.

What is it?

Medicine you can use.

For nature or harmony.

No we don't.

Okay.

So roll, add, hold on.

Wait can I ask a question?

I got an 11 plus 6\.

You align a lens towards nature.

Lovely thank you.

Alright the verdant method turns on because it is befriended by you.

No you do an action you do a lens.

Okay hold on.

Sure.

Can I kill it to try to convince the other mephits that killing this dude is cool and not us?

Okay you want it to use its action for that?

Actually I'm going to do that.

I was going to try to convince the others but kill them.

Kill them good.

Like a persuasion check on your mephit.

You already did that.

Hold on.

The mephit launches a barrage of magically charged thorns at lord auric.

Gets a 19 to hit.

Which hits.

And does 1d6 plus 2 damage.

You want to roll it?

6 plus 2 to 8\.

Wow alright 8 points of damage.

Thorns slam into it and it is now your turn.

Do you want to align a lens?

Who is here?

And you still have your physical lens.

We have verdant blank blank starlight and baddie.

I'm going to take a I was going to talk to a blink mephit.

Which is what?

To talk to, to try to convince the blink mephit that is displacement you can use any one of the following skills.

Acrobatics Sleight of hand, stealth investigation persuasion right?

deception Okay.

Because deception is like misdirection.

You know?

How would acrobatics And this is for aligning a disc?

No this is for convincing the blink mephit.

What is celestial?

Celestial is arcana price.

Arcana, religion.

Arcana, religion?

Insight Perception or performance.

He has a plus five perception.

He has a plus five perception.

And a plus five arcana.

How about I do a plus five Okay.

Does a ten make?

Ten total?

No, not quite.

But he's not angered either.

Now you have a free action and you can align a lens if you wish.

Wait can I touch it?

Let's try this check again.

Free action, align lens if you wish.

Remember missing will create another method.

What's that?

Mechanical.

Okay go for it.

Mechanistic.

Well you actually first you tell me what the skill is that you want to use.

Um, um, um What's the What's the um What's the um What is it for What is it for What is it for For mechanistic?

Yes.

Athletics, sleight of hand, arcana History, investigation.

Okay.

So I get a Which one are you going to Roll?

Wait what?

You haven't rolled yet.

You haven't rolled yet.

Yeah roll.

You've got to declare your thing and then roll.

Um Two.

That's a nine.

Oh yeah this is Oh.

And what skill are you using did you say?

I am using Arcana Arcana?

Oh okay.

Or plus five.

Yes so I get a Fourteen.

And were you Trying for mechanistic or celestial?

For um mechanistic.

So mechanistic you can't use arcana for it.

Yes you can.

Oh you can?

Yes.

However fourteen is not quite enough And congratulations you have created A gear method.

It is at Initiative fifteen.

That's above the points.

Alright.

So now we've got a bunch Of Of Can I see the picture of this one?

The gear method?

No it's above Lunara.

Uh Lunara what did you roll?

Fourteen.

You rolled it for your Nature gear?

Alright one two three four five.

What were the blink methods?

Okay gear method goes after Alaric.

So I said one two three four five and a six Is Alaric.

Two sixes.

So Gear blink and It's another six.

All three of them go after Alaric.

What is that?

Six times six times six.

The elements are with us brothers.

The elements are with us brothers.

Four hours.

Guys\!

Okay somebody roll one d8 plus Two for the first Gear method.

I got the one d8.

But then the other one is now.

Alright.

That's two that's eight.

Alright.

And then the First blink method.

Where is it's attack up here?

Miss.

Second blink method.

Miss.

Starlight method.

Is going to attack you.

Me?

You.

Why?

Because I rolled a three.

Alright.

Cone of sparkling starlight hits you.

Constitution save DC 13\.

Thank you.

Thank you for stealing my die.

You're welcome. 13 plus 2\.

Okay you make it.

Yay.

So you take half damage which is three and you are not glowing.

You have to say like you dodge out of the way.

Right right.

Well it's through pure force of will.

Alright.

Lord Alaric is up.

Lord Alaric is very upset.

Is he?

Holds up his hand.

Points at you who are glowing.

So he gets advantage on you.

And you happen to be in the line between you and you.

And he casts lightning bolt.

I cast lightning bolt.

And hits the two of you.

I have 21\.

Well let me take a look at how lightning bolt works.

So I'm going to die.

This is not good for either one of you.

Yeah.

Could you not have jumped her?

Jasper you're at four and Max you're at nine.

Wait Bryce you're at 24 still.

Yeah.

And Pocky's at 12 and you're at 21\.

I've never changed hit points in this entire campaign.

Yup.

Me too.

I think it was good I went to that shop and healed my scratch.

Alright and after that Val and then Pocky.

So think about what you're going to do as I'm looking at this spell.

Again in the last focus.

It's not your last though.

It is.

I used one in the gear and I used one here so I'm going to use it on the I'm not getting.

Jordan do you know what lightning bolt is off the top of your head?

Lightning bolt?

Probably like a DC.

A full lightning bolt?

Yes.

Oh like the save?

No.

How does the spell work?

The spell is a line and it is I believe 66\.

Okay.

But I would have to check.

Begin.

Uh oh.

Yeah I'm going to leave the party now and I think I have to go home.

So back to that tavern idea you guys suggested.

No sorry 8d6.

And it was all a big dream we woke up to.

Okay a stroke of lightning forming a 100 foot long 5 foot wide line blasts out from you in a direction you choose.

Each creature in the line makes a dexterity saving throw taking 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Okay.

So hold on I'm going to say I'm going to roll for each one of you to see which of you are in the line.

He's definitely aiming at you because you're glowing.

So Why am I glowing?

I am right actually.

You are not.

You are.

You are.

You're already in the line.

And you are.

So all four of you but not you.

He has not taken a single point of damage this entire game.

I got four.

You should have played a rogue.

He got lucky.

So 1,2,3,4,5,6 It's hard to hit.

It's 8d.

So I know.

7 Is there an 8?

You're rolling d6 is there?

Yeah.

Okay.

There should be another one but I think I pulled all of them out.

No I guess so the math works out.

Alright 2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,10,11,17, Wait no saving throw?

21, 25\. 25 points of damage if you roll a dc14 dex saving throw you take half damage.

So how much health do you have?

I'm still gonna die.

It's 12\.

You're not dead.

You're just 0\.

Lunar how much health do you have?

24\.

Wait can you roll survival?

No.

It's like if you're trapped in the woods and you need to find food.

Okay.

16 You didn't have to roll and that's a that is a trouble of Roll d20.

Well how many hit points do you have?

6 plus 5\.

Then you're down.

You're at 0 no matter if you save or not.

So I'm not actually fully dead?

And then Lunara what did you roll for your?

10\.

Okay so you take 10 points of damage.

Yes no.

For money.

Yeah okay sure.

I take 25 points of damage.

So I'm at negative 21\.

So you're at 0 basically.

No.

I'm not actually dead.

Okay so you two are down.

Okay so Val you're down.

Pocky you're up.

So I have 12 hit points.

He's down.

Did you make your save?

Yeah but it doesn't matter.

13\.

Okay so you're down.

He's down.

He's half health.

You're half health and you're up.

I'm healthy.

Malrakech you're up.

So I just witnessed an explosion of lightning take out my entire team.

So are you going to hit him or are you going to channel more?

I think the world needs more displacement. (laughter) Let's go.

Wilson\!

I will be channeling three orbs.

Can I just say good game now or like what?

You don't have your lens on.

Wait I don't have my lens anymore?

Okay then I'll actually I'll use witch bolt on him.

I didn't roll.

I think the world needs more.

He doesn't have enough health.

It doesn't matter.

Okay witch bolt is a \+5 to hit.

And I can't get advantage because everything says.

Wait can I use my does this count for spells?

My like prep?

My steady aim?

No.

But it says attack.

On your next attack roll on the current turn.

Yeah sure.

Go for it.

But I don't think you have a move this turn.

So I don't think it's a sneak attack.

But you do get the advantage to hit.

So I have advantage to hit.

It's \+5.

Is it spell?

I get a 13\.

No 12\.

What's your plus to hit?

\+5 to hit. 12 does not hit.

You rolled a 2 and a 7\.

Okay I'm done.

Did you want to align a lens?

I would love to align a lens.

Reaction.

Which one do you want?

I'm going to roll a 1\.

I slide a hand.

19 \+ 8\.

That's enough.

You align another displacement lens.

There's going to be so much displacement in this next 100 years.

Alright.

The world's all going to die because we're not going to defeat this thing.

Oh could I have like picked you guys up?

Yes\!

Lunara.

The verdant method hits and so you roll damage 26 \+ 2\.

Oh 6\.

So 8 points again.

He is wiped out.

Do you want to align a lens?

Wait the Wait no I want to wait the guy the noble's dead?

The noble's dead.

Actually dead?

Let's get like knocked out.

I'm going to talk to the methods and say let's be good guys and not kill everyone.

Okay.

Make a nature check.

No I want to talk to everyone just the roll nothing else.

This is going to be risky.

Does a 13 make it?

13 \+ add your nature.

7\.

20\.

30\.

20\.

You manage to calm the angry methods.

Do you want to try to align a lens?

I was going to Yes it's a reaction.

Yes and I'm going to make the methods I'm going to prepare the methods to persuade the next to next he comes.

What skill do you want to use?

I'm going to more nature less displacement.

But 19\.

19\.

Nature it is Very natural century.

Alright.

So.

We need to like roll a couple of harmonies and mechanicals otherwise the entire world is going to go into displacement ruin.

And nature.

I'm okay with nature.

We'll stay with nature.

Alright the final click of the orrery echoes through the elven sanctum followed by a surge of energy that hums through everpeak's ancient halls.

The lenses pulse in alignment their proportions reflecting the decisions of the party.

A dominant focus on displacement.

A secondary emphasis on celestial and nature while mechanistic and harmony play quieter roles.

The new era of everpeak.

Displacement dominance.

A realm of connection.

Everpeak becomes a hub of unparalleled connectivity.

The displacement assets now dominant weaves its power into the very fabric of the citadel.

Paths and tunnels within everpeak subtly rearrange themselves to shorten distances.

Making one distance areas feel mere and more distant.

Steps away.

Couriers and travelers marvel as trade routes expand far beyond the mountains connecting everpeak to cities and kingdoms that once seemed unreachable.

Rumors spread of impossible feats.

Travelers reaching far off destinations in days instead of weeks and lost paths mysteriously appearing when most needed.

The courier tunnels become legendary and everpeak earns a reputation as the crossroads of the realms.

However this newfound fluidity comes with challenges.

The ever shifting paths sometimes confound those unused to the district.

And occasional spatial distortions on subtle visitors.

Celestial Insight.

A haven of scholars.

The alignment's celestial influence attracts astronomers, scholars, and mystics from across the realm.

The citadel's observatory becomes a beacon for those seeking wisdom in the stars.

We're almost there.

Celestial Essence infuse everpeak's festivals with luminous night skies displaying constellations that felt close enough to the touch.

Many claim the citadel itself whispers insights during moments of meditation.

Aligning personal destinies with a cosmic weave.

Nature's renewal.

A fragile balance.

While nature essence plays a quieter role, its impact is undeniable.

The orchard gardens flourish once more.

Their bounty sustaining both everpeak's residents and its growing trade.

Yet the temperate emphasis means the land requires careful stewardship.

Rowan, Oak and Shade, and Lunara become champions of this balance.

Tirelessly ensuring the orchards and gardens thrive amid the demands of a bustling hub.

Can we still move on?

Okay, hold on.

Mechanistic decline.

A forgotten art.

Mechanistic essence fades into the background.

Its once thriving forges and gear works becoming relics of a bygone era.

Barthodrao Blacksmith preserves what knowledge he can.

But the reduced emphasis means Everpeak's engineering marvels fall into disrepair.

Artisans lament the loss, though some find solace in adapting mechanistic techniques to complement the citadel's displacement focused innovations.

And finally, Harmony's subtle echo.

Does not exist.

Fragmented unity.

With Harmony playing a minimal role, Everpeak's community experiences subtle fractures.

While collaboration flourishes in specific areas like the shared triumph of displacement routes or celestial studies, conflicts over priorities occasionally arise.

Festivals lack the unifying resonance they once held, and diplomacy requires more effort.

Sorrel, who had hoped for a more balanced Harmony, offers gentle guidance, though he respects the party's choices.

Well, it's not the party's choices.

I would have picked some very different choices if I would have.

I would have picked different choices.

I would have displaced three times instead of That's the same choice.

That is the same choice.

It would have been like, fun.

Thank you all for playing Everpeak Gaming.

This was really fun.
