                <div class="section-content">
                    Sorrel is secretly a gold dragon wyrmling observing and testing the party's worth. Appearing as a curious halfling child, Sorrel has been watching Everpeak Citadel and its inhabitants for some time. This ancient creature uses the innocent guise to move freely through the citadel, guiding worthy heroes toward cooperation and protecting the citadel's secrets. Sorrel is drawn to acts of heroism and kindness, quietly steering adventurers toward the greater good while maintaining the halfling disguise until the moment of greatest need.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Cheerful, inquisitive, unexpectedly wise. Tilts head thoughtfully, praises small acts of heroism, and quietly steers people toward cooperation. Avoids lying but deflects direct questions with half-truths. Supportive and encouraging, rarely criticizes but asks gentle questions to guide others. Occasionally slips up and says something far too wise for a "child," then quickly coughs or shrugs it off.</p>
