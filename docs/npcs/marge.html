                <div class="section-content">
                    Marge has served as Head Librarian of Everpeak's Grand Library for decades. She is the foremost expert on the citadel's incomplete historical records and has dedicated her life to preserving what knowledge remains of the high elves and their vanishing. Marge mentors young scholars like Apocalypse Winter and helps guide those seeking to understand the Dawn's Crown alignment and the citadel's elemental essences. Despite the gaps in the archives, she maintains hope that the right people asking the right questions might piece together the truth.
