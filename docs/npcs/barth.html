                <div class="section-content">
                    Barth is the master blacksmith of Everpeak's Dawnforge workshop, trusted by both Prismor and Malrik. He has built his reputation on quality craftsmanship and careful attention to the properties of different metals. Recently troubled by the theft of a strange alloy called "frozen iron," Barth has noticed suspicious activity around the forge. He has heard rumors of cloaked figures asking about forging keys or ancient locks, making him uneasy. Despite his wariness, he's willing to help those he trusts by reforging fragments into useful items.
