                <div class="section-content">
                    Lord Alric is a wealthy and ambitious human noble who seeks to control the Mechanistic Essence during the Dawn's Crown alignment for his own dominance. Haughty and supremely confident, he has orchestrated the theft of crystal lenses and the forging of a special frozen iron key to manipulate the citadel's ancient orrery. Working with drow conspirators, Alric plans to flood certain essences at midnight, creating unstoppable constructs or elemental weapons to subjugate Everpeak Citadel. He treats most people as pawns or tools, maintaining outward calm even when threatened. His ultimate goal is absolute power over the citadel and its magical resources.

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Haughty, supremely confident, condescending, and ruthlessly ambitious. Polished and controlled in speech and manner. Never shouts but projects strong authority when needed. Treats others as beneath him—pawns to be manipulated. Dismissive of arguments he finds irrelevant. Smiles coldly without warmth in his eyes. Remains outwardly calm when threatened but grows furious if truly cornered. Absolutely convinced of his own superiority and right to power.</p>
