                    Lunara is old enough to remember a world before she journeyed to Everpeak, though she did not grow up in the citadel. She came decades ago, following the quiet plea spread through many lands after the last alignment.</p><p>Drawn by her druidic calling and curiosity, Lunara has dedicated herself to tending Everpeak's living gardens and green spaces that thrive at this unnatural altitude. She helps maintain the delicate balance of Nature Essence flowing through the citadel.
