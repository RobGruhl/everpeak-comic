                    <p>Val was born high in the Dawnforge Mountains, just a few ridges away from Everpeak Citadel. Raised by monks who answered the century-old call to resettle the citadel after the high elves vanished, Val grew up with few certainties but many quiet rituals.</p><p>Now in his early twenties, Val serves as a courier for the Citadel, using his knowledge of hidden footpaths and chalk-marked routes to deliver messages throughout Everpeak. His training emphasizes balance and service, and he carries the monks' teachings of harmony wherever he goes.</p>
