Malrik has noticed there's something unusual about this child - the way Sorrel watches, the intelligence in those golden-amber eyes, the too-perceptive observations. Malrik leaning down to child's level, intrigued and curious. Sorrel looking up with expression that shows far more understanding than age would suggest. Both positioned at or near gaming table. Festival marketplace in background. Moment of connection between observant rogue and disguised dragon - both clever individuals recognizing cleverness in the other.\n\nDialogue:\n- Malrik (friendly, testing): \"Just a bit of fun. You like games, kid?\"\n- Sorrel (with wisdom beyond years): \"I like watching clever people at work.\"\n\nInclude speech bubbles with dialogue text clearly readable.\n\nStyle: Bold ink line art, vibrant colors, dynamic composition, sequential art style, graphic novel quality. Subtle hints that Sorrel is more than they appear."
