Corrupted rune visible - partially smudged with Pocky's attempted corrections. Soft blue magical glow beginning to form as he works. Sweat on brow despite cool tunnel. Other party members watching tensely in background. Fantasy dungeon with risky magical repair attempt.\n\nDialogue: Pocky (concentrating, hopeful): \"If I can just realign this symbol...\"\n\nInclude speech bubble with dialogue text clearly readable.\n\nStyle: Bold ink line art, medieval fantasy setting, high fantasy atmosphere,, vibrant colors, dynamic composition, sequential art style, graphic novel quality, medieval fantasy dungeon atmosphere, underground tunnel setting, tense magical repair attempt."
